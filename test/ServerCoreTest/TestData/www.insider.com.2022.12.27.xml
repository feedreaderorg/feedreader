<li>A car dealer dragged a generator for four hours through the snow to power a shelter in Buffalo, NY.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Vive Shelter was without power for 27 hours after Buffalo was hit by a blizzard.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The shelter&#39;s founder said they could have been without power longer had the dealership saved them.</li>
</ul><p>When a Buffalo, New York, shelter was without power for 27 hours, its founder phoned a friend for a potentially live-saving favor.&nbsp;</p><p>Friday&#39;s blizzard, <a href="https://www.insider.com/death-toll-in-buffalo-winter-storm-2022-12">in which at least 27 people have died</a>, cut the power in Vive Shelter&#39;s old, rundown building. Temperatures quickly dropped in the shelter as the windchill outside hit well below zero degrees Fahrenheit. For the next 27 hours, Vive had no power, leaving its residents cold and in the dark.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#39;s when Myron Glick, the founder and CEO of Jericho Road Community Health Center, which runs Vive, decided it was time to reach out to a good friend who might be able to help: Scott Bieler, the CEO of West Herr Automotive Group.&nbsp;</p><p>Bieler initially told Glick he was sending a team of electricians on a truck, <a href="https://www.wivb.com/news/local-news/generator-takes-four-hour-ride-to-save-150-people-in-buffalo-shelter-during-blizzard/">local news outlet WIVB4 reported</a>, but, according to Glick, they couldn&#39;t make it because the roads were too bad.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;I was really stressed out,&#34; Glick told WIVB4.</p><p>Glick thought that was it, until Bieler called him back with a new solution, determined to get Vive&#39;s power up and running.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Scott called me again and said, &#39;We found a payloader &mdash; one of those big tractors with a scoop on the front &mdash; we&#39;re going to drag our generator into town on this payloader,&#39;&#34; Glick told WIVB4.&nbsp;</p><p>Bieler followed through on his promise.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/JerichoRoadCommunityHealthCenter/posts/pfbid0kgkLb4cCui6K4FLu8oerSF7Mpo9GGdwiovxZHNRwwA8BVYxNKsXNN4aNLw6h7GfWl">According to Jericho Road Community Health Center&#39;s Facebook page</a>, Bieler&#39;s team dragged the generator through the snow from Hamburg, New York, to the shelter in Buffalo. The 15-mile journey took them four hours to complete as &#34;the roads in Buffalo are almost impassable due to the deep snow and many abandoned vehicles along the way,&#34; Vive said on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Glick told WIVB 4 that it could have been another 27 hours without power had Bieler not come to the rescue.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;We are deeply grateful for this act of love by Scott and his entire team,&#34; Jericho Road Community Health Center&#39;s Facebook page said. &#34;We are also grateful for our Jericho Road Staff members, including the VIVE Director, Matt Tice, who are putting in these long hours staying on duty at VIVE.&#34;</p><p>Vive Shelter houses refugees either looking to apply for US asylum or awaiting their appointments with the Canadian Border Service.</p><p><a href="http://www.jrchc.org/vive2/">According to the shelter&#39;s website</a>, Vive is currently at capacity. There are 150 people living there from around 15 different countries, according to Jericho Road Community Health Center&#39;s Facebook page.&nbsp;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.insider.com/car-dealer-payloader-dragged-generator-4-hours-buffalo-shelter-2022-12">Insider</a></div>]]>

			<link>https://www.insider.com/guides/kitchen/best-soda-maker</link>
			<description>We tested soda makers from Sodastream, Drinkmate, and more. Here are the best soda makers in 2023, plus one that can make sparkling wine.</description>

From fan-favorite La Croix to <a href="https://www.insider.com/guides/kitchen/sanzo-sparkling-water-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanzo</a>, which was founded by a Filipino-American entrepreneur and focuses on Asian flavors like calamansi, we love the fizzy stuff. If you&#39;re devoting a lot of your budget and fridge space to seltzer, investing in a soda maker might be the solution.</p><p>Soda makers work by injecting CO2 into a liquid. Some machines want you to stick to plain water and add flavorings after the fact, while others allow you to carbonate beverages like juice, tea, and wine.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to determine the best soda makers out there, we tested six of them based on ease of use, consistency, and levels of fizziness compared to store-bought seltzer. We also spoke to beverage scientist <a href="https://imbibeinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Johnson of Imbibe, Inc</a>. You&#39;ll find an <a href="https://www.insider.com/guides/kitchen/best-soda-maker#soda-maker-faqs-7">FAQ section</a> below that explains the basics of carbonation as well as how to best replace and recycle your empty CO2 canisters.

It buzzes to let you know to stop carbonating, and it&#39;s one of the only machines that allows you to vent some of the built-up pressure through a valve on the carbonator lid. This helps to prevent messy overflow.</p><p>I also carbonated apple juice in the <a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20&amp;postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d43&amp;site=in&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB018K1C2ME%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dbiipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB018K1C2ME%26linkId%3D49636c677f049dc39476f2550f0c1f36" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored">Drinkmate</a> and was able to get the same level of carbonation I got with water using the same single charge. Because the apple juice was denser than water, it foamed up quite a bit while carbonating, which did cause some to leak out the top of the bottle. I was able to mitigate it during a second round of testing by filling the bottle slightly less and keeping a closer eye on the level of foam forming during the process. Just be sure to be ready to take your finger off the button before things get messy, and you should be fine.</p><p>If things do go awry, everything can be rinsed pretty easily with dish soap and water. But remember, the components are not dishwasher safe.</p></div><div class="slide">Best upgrade soda maker<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6081df084becb800190f6a6b?format=jpeg" height="900" width="1200" charset="" alt="The aarke carbonator iii in white, showing the bottle suspended from the carbonator top, our best upgrade soda maker"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Jen Gushue/Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The <a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20&amp;postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d43&amp;site=in&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08HR61Z3D%2F%3Fth%3D1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored">Aarke Carbonator III</a> uses a simple pull-down handle to create intense levels of fizz, and its beautiful design will fit right in among your countertop appliances.</strong></p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Sleek design, simple carbonation mechanism, doesn&#39;t need electricity, doesn&#39;t take up much space</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No CO2 canister included with purchase, multiple charges needed to get high levels of carbonation, only carbonates water, bottles not dishwasher safe</p><p>Like every small kitchen appliance, the more your soda maker is accessible to you, the more likely you are to use it regularly, so you may want to prioritize aesthetics so you can keep it on your counter.

It&#39;s a bit more manual than the One-Touch, but the auditory trigger that your soda&#39;s carbonated is a nice safety mechanism that removes a lot of the guesswork.</p></div><div class="slide">Best soda maker with no CO2 canister<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6081dfe81041d50019f2dbba?format=jpeg" height="900" width="1200" charset="" alt="The sparkel in white with a hand operating the buttons, our best soda maker with no co2"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Jen Gushue/Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The <a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20&amp;postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d43&amp;site=in&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07YNTZCNW%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dbiipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB07YNTZCNW%26linkId%3Dead6de68705f1eb60c34bcfe86c3b83c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored">Sparkel Beverage System</a> used a proprietary mix of baking soda and citric acid to generate CO2 without a canister, and you can carbonate any liquid and even infuse it with solid ingredients.</strong></p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>No CO2 canister needed, dishwasher safe bottle, can infuse sodas with solid ingredients, can carbonate any liquid</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Much more complicated process than other soda makers, bottle is smaller in capacity than other soda makers, takes much longer to carbonate than other soda makers</p><p>Most soda makers work by injecting CO2 gas directly from a metal canister housed in the machine into the liquid. Once the canister is empty, it needs to be replaced, and most companies allow you to order new canisters and mail back your empties. But if you can&#39;t be bothered with this process or simply don&#39;t want to deal with canisters of pressurized gas, the <a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20&amp;postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d43&amp;site=in&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07YNTZCNW%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dbiipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB07YNTZCNW%26linkId%3Dead6de68705f1eb60c34bcfe86c3b83c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored">Sparkel</a> has provided an alternative.</p><p>The mechanism is a bit more complex than other soda makers. Each charge requires you to add two packets of powder into the machine &mdash; baking soda and citric acid. These chemicals mix with water from a reservoir in the back of the machine to generate CO2. That gas is then pulled out of the reservoir water and injected into the liquid you&#39;re carbonating. Wastewater then moves into a separate tank you&#39;ll toss away.</p><p>The whole process takes much longer than your average soda maker &mdash; 90 seconds for a level one slight fizz all the way up to four minutes for a level five stronger-than-store-bought fizz.

The Sparkel not only injects CO2 but also pressurizes the bottle as it does so, which allows the flavors of the ingredients you add to infuse into the soda.</p><p>I carbonated both water and apple juice on the highest setting and was very satisfied by the level of fizz and consistency of carbonation.

It&#39;s a simple single-button design, but it doesn&#39;t give you any visual or auditory signal to stop carbonating. I wasn&#39;t able to get as strong a fizz as other models even after holding the button down for as long as 15 seconds. There&#39;s just too much room for user error and second-guessing yourself. It&#39;s affordable, but you&#39;re better off spending a bit more for consistency and ease of use.</p><p><a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20&amp;postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d43&amp;site=in&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB011P0X762%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dbiipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB011P0X762%26linkId%3D3cf76979518ed97110d1c7e7df2dfb9f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored"><strong>iSi Soda Siphon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A soda siphon like this is fun to use, but is better suited for vaudevillian sight gags than getting consistently carbonated seltzer. It produced the least fizzy seltzer of any soda maker I tried and the batches varied widely.</p></div><div class="slide">Our soda maker testing methodology<p>We tested six soda makers for ease of use, consistency, and strength of carbonation. For each soda maker, I took note of how easy each was to assemble, the steps required in the carbonation process, and the cleaning process. For machines that provided less guidance in how long to carbonate for, I tested how easy it was to get consistent batches of soda.</p><p>I carbonated both tap-cold and fridge-cold water in each machine. I also carbonated apple juice in the two machines that allowed for carbonating liquids beyond water. I compared each batch to store-bought Vintage brand seltzer to determine the difference in fizziness.</p><p>I discovered that carbonating fridge-cold liquids produced a much fizzier soda than water straight from the tap. I also discovered that some models required multiple charges in order to get the level of carbonation I desired.</p></div><div class="slide">Soda maker FAQs<h3 class="faq-question">Is it worth it to buy a soda maker?</h3><p class="faq-answer">If you drink seltzer every day, then yes. A 60L canister produces roughly 60L of sparkling water on the lowest carbonation setting. Even with more carbonation and an output of 30L, you still get the equivalent of 85 12-ounce cans. Plus, the soda maker bottles are reusable, unlike aluminum cans and plastic bottles. You do have to stay on top of your cylinder stock &mdash; running out of gas in the middle of the week can be a pain. If you just have a glass or two of seltzer during the week, the maintenance and cost of switching might not be worth it.</p><hr/><h3 class="faq-answer faq-question">What if I want to carbonate a non-water beverage?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The Drinkmate is the best soda maker for non-water beverages. The main issue with carbonating juices and other drinks is that the bottle can overflow and the thicker liquid can clog the machine. Drinkmate soda makers have a fizz infuser cap that is easily cleaned and allows you to slowly release pent-up air from the bottle. We do not recommend carbonating beverages other than water in soda makers, and doing so can void the warranty.&nbsp;</p><hr/><h3 class="faq-question">How long does a CO2 canister last?</h3><p class="faq-answer">All of the soda makers on our list (with the exception of the Sparkel) use 60L CO2 canisters. That means each canister carbonates roughly 60 liters of water. Each bottle holds roughly one liter, so you&#39;ll get about 60 bottles of soda out of one canister. This can vary depending on how fizzy you like your soda. If you use more CO2 per bottle, you&#39;ll likely get fewer total bottles out of your canister.</p><hr/><h3 class="faq-question">How do I get replacement CO2 canisters?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The great thing about 60L CO2 canisters is that the design is universal. This means that regardless of the brand of your machine, you can order CO2 canisters from any manufacturer and they will fit. Many brands offer recycling programs that allow you to return your empties when you order new ones.</p><p class="faq-answer"><a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_081318_best-soda-makers-20&amp;postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d43&amp;site=in&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsodastream.com%2Fproducts%2Fexchange-cylinder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">SodaStream</a>&#39;s exchange program is the most cost-effective we&#39;ve found. For a total of $37.97 ($29.98, plus $7.99 shipping), you&#39;ll get two full CO2 canisters and a prepaid USPS shipping label that allows you to send back two empty canisters.

They&#39;re filled with a recycled foam bled called Durafoam, and they don&#39;t have any beans or beads inside.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the major benefits of Lovesac is that they provide a lot of options.

Be sure you&#39;re ready for the investment and that you have the space in your home. If you do, you&#39;ll have one of the most popular and comfortable bean bag chairs available.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">Best kids bean bag chair<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63a5e1de51c15900190c1cbf?format=jpeg" height="900" width="1200" charset="" alt="Three of the Pottery Barn Kids Anywhere Beanbag Chair."/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Pottery Barn Kids</p></figcaption></figure><p>Kids can have their own special place to lounge, read, or do homework with the <a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_080818_best-bean-bag-chairs-20&amp;postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d31&amp;site=in&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.potterybarnkids.com%2Fproducts%2Fanywhere-navy-recycled-beanbag%2F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Pottery Barn Kids Anywhere Beanbag</a>, which has many designs and fabric options to choose from.</p><aside class="breakout-box headline-regular ignore-typography"><ul><li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>37.5&#34; x 31&#34;</li><li><strong>Weight: </strong>3.5 lbs</li><li><strong>Machine-washable cover: </strong>Yes</li><li><strong>Cover material: </strong>Twill, polyester sherpa, chamois, polyester faux fur</li><li><strong>Interior material: </strong>Polystyrene</li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Lots of design and personalization options, lightweight, machine-washable cover&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Kids might outgrow it quickly&nbsp;</p><p>Most kids appreciate a comfy space they can call their own, which is why they&#39;ll enjoy a bean bag chair for their bedroom or in a special nook in another room. The Pottery Barn Kids Anywhere Bag comes in nearly 30 variations, from an R2-D2 version to a sherpa bear. You can even have it personalized with their name or monogram. There are plenty of neutral design options, too, if you want something to match your home decor.&nbsp;</p><p>The chair is available with four different cover options, all of which are machine washable: twill, sherpa, ribbed chamois, and polyester faux fur. According to Guan, faux fur is &#34;cozy and soft but can be a bit high maintenance when it comes to cleaning.&#34; Patterned fabric, she says, can work great for a child&#39;s room.&nbsp;</p><p>The chair is definitely on the smaller side, so kids are likely to outgrow it by the time they&#39;re tweens or teens. If you&#39;re looking for something for a toddler or younger kid to grow with, this is a great pick. Older kids might want to look into one of our other top picks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The chair is filled with up to 50% recycled polystyrene, and it&#39;s Greenguard Gold Certified.

This is the type of bean bag chair you can really sink into either by yourself or with a few friends. It&#39;s filled with shredded foam which makes it fluffy and plush. Shredded foam is a dense and supportive fill option that also stays comfortable even after extended use. Simply re-fluff if the chair starts to go flat.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the biggest downsides, which is to be expected with an oversized bean bag chair, is that it&#39;s very large, heavy, and cumbersome. The bean bag chair weighs over 70 pounds, so it&#39;s not easy to move around. It does have an attached carrying handle to make maneuvering it a bit easier. The massive size might also mean it&#39;s too big for some spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>You can choose from either plush or lenox material for the cover; both are a polyester blend. According to the brand, the lenox material has a denim feel while the plush is softer. The lenox is available in three neutral colors, and the plush comes in three neutrals or three vibrant colors and patterns. Both cover types are machine washable.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">Best gaming bean bag chair<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63a5e75e0e0f6b0018291466?format=jpeg" height="900" width="1200" charset="" alt="A woman sleeping in the Moon Pod Bean Bag Chair."/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Moon Pod</p></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_080818_best-bean-bag-chairs-20&amp;postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d31&amp;site=in&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moonpod.co%2Fproducts%2Fmoon-pod" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Moon Pod</a> is comfortable, lightweight, and versatile, supporting your body in an upright position so you can spend hours gaming.&nbsp;</p><aside class="breakout-box headline-regular ignore-typography"><ul><li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>50&#34; x 20&#34; x 20&#34; (approximate)</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 12 lbs</li><li><strong>Machine-washable cover: </strong>Yes</li><li><strong>Cover material: </strong>Proprietary fabric blend similar to polyester</li><li><strong>Interior material: </strong>EPS beads</li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Shape is versatile, machine-washable cover, lightweight</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Limited cover material and color options&nbsp;</p><p>When you spend a lot of time gaming, a comfortable chair is a necessity.

The outer cover is removable and machine washable. The brand describes the chair as amorphous, because it conforms to your body. That means the chair&#39;s dimensions are approximate: 50 to 56 inches long by 20 to 24 inches high and 20 to 24 inches wide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Former Insider contributor Maliah West found the Moon Pod to be cushiony and simple to set up. &#34;The chair is comfortable and provides enough support to work sitting up but is still cozy enough for a quick nap,&#34; she said.

We strongly suggest paying attention to measurements when shopping and even taking the time to measure your room prior to making any purchases.</p><hr/><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How do you clean a bean bag chair?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Bean bag chairs either have a removable cover or a non-removable cover. You can easily machine wash and dry most removable covers. Non-removable covers need to be spot cleaned, which may be difficult depending on the fabric.</p><hr/><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What are the best materials to look for when purchasing a bean bag chair?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Inside the chair typically contains polystyrene beads or shredded foam. Beads are less supportive and compress over time. Foam-filled bags need re-plumping to retain its shape. For the outside, the material mostly depends on your style preferences.</p><hr/><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How do you refill a flat bean bag chair?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Your bean bag chair may flatten after sitting and laying on it over time. Not every bag is refillable.

the stylist said.</p></div><div class="slide">White sneakers add a sporty feel to any look.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/639a0bc9b7e0f200180905fe?format=jpeg" height="2416" width="3221" charset="" alt="White Sneakers"/><figcaption>White sneakers are a versatile closet staple.<p class="copyright">Pablo Cuadra/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>Sneakers are also trending for the New Year, according to West.</p><p>You can pair <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-keep-white-sneakers-white-clean-2018-7">crisp white tennis shoes</a> with dresses, skirts, trousers, or shorts.</p><p>&#34;A chic sneaker always adds a sporty feel to any look and is so comfortable,&#34;

Young told Insider.</p></div><div class="slide">A reimagined kitten heel is making its way back onto the scene.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/639a16d027c0a700193e21d2?format=jpeg" height="957" width="1276" charset="" alt="kitten heels"/><figcaption>Millennials may be over kitten heels, but they&#39;re making a comeback.<p class="copyright">Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>A &#34;cool-girl&#34;

			<description>On Revolt, Michelle Obama said her marriage with her husband, Barack Obama, was hardest when they had young kids, but she is glad they didn&#39;t give up.</description>

				<![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fff1dc3a8de7700187d39ba?format=jpeg" height="2731" width="4096" charset="" alt="obama family"/><figcaption>President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, and daughters Sasha and Malia Obama in 2009.<p class="copyright">Annie Leibovitz/White House/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><ul class="summary-list">
<li>Michelle Obama said there were 10 years of her marriage where she &#34;couldn&#39;t stand&#34; Barack.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When the girls were young, she said she&#39;d start &#34;measuring&#34; tasks and wanting them all to be 50/50.&nbsp;</li>
<li>On the Revolt special, the author said &#34;knowing your person&#34; helps you get past rough stretches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Marriage isn&#39;t about splitting tasks 50/50 or even liking each other all of the time, according to Michelle Obama. In fact, <a href="https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/michelle-obama-on-sustaining-30-year-marriage-and-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she said on the Revolt x Michelle Obama special</a>, she endured a whole decade of tension with her husband, Barack, when their daughters were young.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;People think I&#39;m being catty for saying this &mdash; it&#39;s like, there were 10 years where I couldn&#39;t stand my husband. Ten years! And guess when it happened? When those kids were little,&#34; Obama, 58, said.</p><p>The Obamas&#39; daughters, now 21 and 24, were 7 and 10 years old when they first lived in the White House.&nbsp;</p><p>On the TV special, hosted by Angie Martinez on December 14, Obama talked about how she&#39;d start <a href="https://www.insider.com/michelle-obama-posts-fathers-day-tribute-to-barack-obama-2021-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#34;measuring&#34; tasks between her and Barack</a>, like how many diapers each changed or how much time Barack spent at the gym.&nbsp;</p><p>Little kids &#34;have demands. They don&#39;t talk. They&#39;re poor communicators. They cry all the time. They&#39;re irrational. They&#39;re needy. And you love them more than anything. And so you can&#39;t blame them,&#34; Obama, author of the new book &#34;The Light We Carry,&#34; said. &#34;So you turn that ire on each other.&#34;&nbsp;</p><p>She said that at first, she was frustrated that things didn&#39;t feel even. But then she realized &#34;marriage isn&#39;t 50/50, ever.&#34;&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;But guess what?&#34; she continued. &#34;Ten years; we&#39;ve been married 30. I would take 10 bad years over 30 &mdash; it&#39;s just how you look at it. People give up &mdash; &#39;Five years; I can&#39;t take it.&#39;&#34;</p><p>Obama, who&#39;s now been married to Barack for 30 years, said it&#39;s important to &#34;know your person&#34; in order to get through those stretches of tension.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Do you like him? I mean, you could be mad at him, but do you still look at him and go, &#39;I&#39;m not happy with you, but I respect you. I don&#39;t agree with you, but you&#39;re still a kind, smart person,&#39;&#34; she said to the host and other panelists, including Tina Lawson, Kelly Rowland, H.E.R., and Winnie Harlow.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;The feelings are gonna change over time,&#34; Obama continued. But <a href="https://www.insider.com/michelle-obama-book-barack-obamas-certainty-was-sexy-as-hell-2022-12">once the infatuation fades</a>, &#34;people wanna give up on it.

But it happened anyway.</p><p>Butcher, who has Poland syndrome, a rare condition that typically results in an absent or underdeveloped chest muscle on one side of the body, started posting about typical 20-something interests &mdash; travel, makeup &mdash; on TikTok, where her largest audience lives, about three years ago. But, as viewers began to notice Butcher&#39;s visibly differently-sized breasts, and she responded to their inquiries, she also found that videos concerning Poland syndrome accrued exceptionally high views.</p><p>So, she made more of them. Some of the videos topped 10 million views. Since then, she&#39;s covered topics that range from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@beccabutcherx/video/7151833548171791622?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7120698119249577518">when she first spotted a difference</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@beccabutcherx/video/7146873719938403590?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7120698119249577518">criticisms of traditional beauty standards</a>.</p><p>As her views ticked upward, so did Butcher&#39;s followers. She&#39;d grown up with a dearth of images of people who looked like her, and she felt gratified by the possibility of doing something meaningful.</p><p>&#34;The more I posted about it,&#34; Butcher told Insider, &#34;the more people told me it helped them. Lots of women said they have the same chest and had never seen anybody who looked like them before or heard anybody talk about it &mdash; they didn&#39;t know it had a name.&#34;</p><h2><strong>Butcher didn&#39;t receive a diagnosis for years.</strong></h2><div id="1671731871015" data-embed-type="custom" data-script="//www.instagram.com/embed.js" class="" data-type="embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/ClGcNwcDuUj/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14" style=" background:#FFF;

&#34;doctors kept saying &#39;every woman has one bigger than the other,&#39;&#34; she said &mdash; she found the term &#34;Poland syndrome&#34; on Google and brought it to her doctors. At 20, she received a diagnosis.</p><p>Poland syndrome is rare. Experts believe it could affect anywhere from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/poland-syndrome/">1 in 10,000 people to 1 in 100,000 people</a>, though the numbers could be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/poland-syndrome#what-it-is">higher with undiagnosed cases</a>. And, as is often the case with rare conditions, people with them often face hurdles in receiving a correct or timely diagnosis. Once they do, they might struggle to create support networks and access resources that help them map out their future.</p><p>Butcher told Insider that when she first started visiting doctors for her condition, they would look up the condition on the computer during her session, only to find mainly news featuring her. &#34;All they were finding were articles about me,&#34; Butcher said. &#34;So I was the one kind of educating them whilst sitting next to them, and they&#39;re reading about me on the computer.&#34;</p><h2><strong>Butcher began posting about her condition in the hopes of finding others like her.</strong></h2><p>Initially, because the only information Butcher found online centered men with the rare condition, Butcher told Insider she felt embarrassed, thinking she had something &#34;that only men could have.&#34; Initially, she wanted to hide her condition. But, eventually, she decided there had to be other people like her.</p><div id="1671731871015" data-embed-type="custom" data-script="//www.instagram.com/embed.js" class="" data-type="embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cmbb-J0jhOp/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14" style=" background:#FFF;

She said she&#39;s seen other posts from women with Poland syndrome online, but, for some reason, none of them have blown up nor gained the traction of hers.

<li>Kayakers rescued a pilot whose plane crashed into a frozen creek in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.&nbsp;</li>

<li>A local official said the kayakers&#39; efforts were &#34;heroic&#34; and probably saved the pilot&#39;s life.</li>
</ul><p>&#34;Heroic&#34; kayakers probably saved the life of a pilot whose plane crashed into a frozen creek in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, police said.</p><p>The pilot, Steve Couchman, took off from Lee Airport on Monday in a Piper Cherokee single-engine plane, according to a statement from <a href="https://news.maryland.gov/msp/2022/12/26/state-police-respond-to-plane-crash-in-anne-arundel-county/">Maryland state police.</a> Witnesses told police they heard the plane&#39;s engine sputtering shortly after take-off before it crashed into Beards Creek, Edgewater.</p><p>Police said two nearby civilians and an on-duty police officer attended the scene and used three kayaks to &#34;skim across the iced creek&#34; to assist the pilot. As the plane sank, the pilot exited and stood on its wing, and when the kayakers were close enough, the pilot held on to one of them to stay afloat, police said.</p><p>Officers from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police arrived at the scene soon after and transported Couchman, 71, to a nearby marina.&nbsp;He was then taken to Anne Arundel Medical Center for medical treatment.</p><p>Anne Arundel County Fire Department Lieutenant Jennifer Macallair said in a video posted by <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/small-plane-down-lee-airport-edgewater-beards-creek/42339639" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-activity-map="article-content-link-5">NBC affiliate WBAL of Baltimore</a> that the pilot&#39;s injuries were not considered life-threatening.</p><p>Macallair said the civilian kayakers&#39; efforts were &#34;heroic&#34; and their rapid response prevented Couchman from getting hypothermia.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Hypothermia can set in within minutes,&#34;&nbsp; Macallair said. &#34;So the fact that these two individuals were able to recognize what happened and got into their kayaks and went out there, absolutely probably saved his life.&#34;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.insider.com/heroic-kayakers-rescue-pilot-whose-plane-crashed-in-frozen-creek-2022-12">Insider</a></div>]]>

<li>Insider ranked 2022&#39;s seven major superhero movie releases from worst to best.</li>
<li>&#34;Morbius&#34; was easily the worst of the bunch. No Marvel sequel lived up to &#34;The Batman.&#34;</li>
<li>The Rock starred in one delightful superhero movie this year, but it wasn&#39;t &#34;Black Adam.&#34;</li>
</ul><div id="slideshow"><div class="slide">7. &#34;Morbius&#34; has one great scene and it doesn&#39;t even feature its leading man.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6391225bad2cb500189f087d?format=jpeg" height="1030" width="2060" charset="" alt="Milo in Morbius"/><figcaption>&#34;Morbius&#34; should&#39;ve been 90 minutes of Matt Smith dancing.<p class="copyright">Sony Pictures</p></figcaption></figure><p>The Jared Leto-starring film, which sees the actor&#39;s Dr. Michael Morbius transform into a vampire hybrid, isn&#39;t the worst superhero movie I&#39;ve ever watched, but it certainly feels like a waste of time. Its trailers largely promised a movie <a href="https://www.insider.com/morbius-michael-keaton-cameo-end-credits-director-explanation-2022-4">featuring Michael Keaton&#39;s Spidey villain</a> and other nods to Spider-Man, but then delivered a film largely devoid of references to either.</p><p>The sole connection to Sony&#39;s live-action Spider-Verse came in the form of two lame and <a href="https://www.insider.com/morbius-end-credits-vulture-explanation-breakdown-2022-3">baffling end-credits scenes</a> which showcased Keaton&#39;s sole appearances in the film.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sony and the movie&#39;s director seemed aware they had a flop on their hands. Bizarrely, they started <a href="https://twitter.com/sonypicturesuk/status/1507456584716328960">spoiling the film on Twitter before its release</a>, perhaps in a last-ditch effort to get fans out to theaters. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2022/06/06/morbius-sweeped-why-sony-brought-jared-leto-box-office-bomb-back-to-theaters/?sh=353892ca6497">It didn&#39;t work</a>.</p><p>At least &#34;Morbius&#34; gave us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3fz7yhdaY">this outrageous gem of Matt Smith dancing provocatively to the words &#34;have sex</a>.&#34; It is the only scene from this movie that you should ever watch.</p></div><div class="slide">6. &#34;Thor: Love and Thunder&#34; is filled with cheap thrills that only work the first time around.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/639127ebad2cb500189f08b0?format=jpeg" height="778" width="1556" charset="" alt="Chris Hemsworth in &#34;Thor Love and Thunder&#34;"/><figcaption>Chris Hemsworth in &#34;Thor Love and Thunder&#34;<p class="copyright">Marvel Studios</p></figcaption></figure><p>Does the film make Jane look cool? Sure. Is Thor a riot? Yeah. But just about every other character seems to suffer at their expense. Either they&#39;re sidelined or are utilized for cheap laughs.</p><p>A brief mention of Thor&#39;s friends, The Warriors Three, feels disrespectful and dismissive of their legacy. The Guardians of the Galaxy feel like shells of themselves, merely around for punchlines at the film&#39;s start.</p><p>Jaimie Alexander&#39;s Sif is oddly sidelined <a href="https://www.insider.com/thor-love-and-thunder-what-happened-to-sif-2022-7">in an overblown cameo</a> after losing her arm off-screen. Jane Foster&#39;s (Natalie Portman) original BFF, Darcy (Kat Dennings), strangely doesn&#39;t receive more screen time with her, especially after Jane becomes embued with superpowers.</p><p>The insertion of two screaming goats throughout the film, <a href="https://www.insider.com/thor-love-and-thunder-screaming-goats-taylor-swift-meme-2022-7">inspired by an outdated Taylor Swift meme</a>, is also meant to elicit laughter, but the bit gets stale quickly.</p><p>The film&#39;s best asset, Christian Bale, gets kneecapped as a villain who barely gets to unleash vengeance on any god despite his moniker of &#34;Gorr the God Butcher.&#34;</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.insider.com/thor-love-and-thunder-review-2022-7">read our review here</a>.</p></div><div class="slide">5.

<li>Many shows struggle to stick the landing when it comes to their season finales or series finales.</li>
<li>Here are some of the best and worst season finales from 2022.</li>
</ul><div id="slideshow"><div class="slide">&#34;The Lord of The Rings: The Rings of Power&#34; finale was a great conclusion to the build-up of the season.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/633210cd003b0d00188b4b65?format=jpeg" height="1067" width="1423" charset="" alt="the rings of power"/><figcaption>Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) is tested in &#34;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&#34; season one finale.<p class="copyright">Prime Video</p></figcaption></figure><p>Due to its slow, seemingly directionless build-up and competition with a more popular fantasy prequel, many viewers turned off &#34;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&#34; before it got to its epic conclusion.</p><p>This is a shame since the last few episodes were everything people loved about Peter Jackson movies: epic battle scenes, developed characters, and edge-of-your-seat plot twists. With Mordor being built and the heroes on the run, the first season finale &#34;Alloyed&#34; had one big revelation left to unveil. <a href="https://www.insider.com/lotr-rings-of-power-season-1-finale-ending-sauron-explained-2022-10">Who is Sauron?</a></p><p>While this villain may not be entirely unexpected, the way this revelation plays out on-screen is incredibly clever. The focus is not really on the reveal itself but on testing the morality of the heroes including <a href="https://www.insider.com/lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-cast-real-life-2022-9">Galadriel (Morfydd Clark)</a>. When put to the test will they stand for what they believe in and what are they willing to risk in order to vanquish their enemy?</p><p>The deconstruction of Galadriel as a hero and the reevaluation of &#34;Lord of The Rings&#34; main villains is one of the most interesting parts of the show and it is brought full circle extremely well in the season finale.&nbsp;</p><p>Frankly, the season finale is an apt conclusion to the first arc of &#34;Rings of Power&#34; and leaves audiences wanting more.</p></div><div class="slide">&#34;Stranger Things&#34; two-hour runtime was worth it for an epic finale.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/62d6eb84bc4c770018b76ee2?format=jpeg" height="1810" width="2413" charset="" alt="stranger things"/><figcaption>&#34;Stranger Things&#34; season four finale ends with the villains winning.<p class="copyright">Netflix</p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.insider.com/stranger-things-season-4-finale-runtime-duffer-brothers-explain-2022-6">With a runtime of over two hours</a>, &#34;Stranger Things&#34; season four&#39;s finale &#34;The Piggyback&#34; was as long as a movie. Yet the season finale was one of the most emotional to come out this year.</p><p>This finale showed the Hawkins gang go up against the greatest foe to date, Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), and most of the heroes barely made it out alive. The finale provided multiple tear-jerking moments: Eddie&#39;s (Joesph Quinn) death, Dustin (Gaetan Matarazzo) having to explain the death to Eddie&#39;s father, and Max&#39;s (Sadie Sink) temporary death.</p><p>The final episode also ends on a cliffhanger that will surely have its audience anxiously waiting for the next and final installment of the series.</p></div><div class="slide">&#34;The Walking Dead&#34; had a satisfying series finale.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63a04836b5600000185b4135?format=jpeg" height="3000" width="3999" charset="" alt="TWD 1124 Daryl and Carol"/><figcaption>A photo from the series&#39; finale shows Daryl injured.<p class="copyright">Jace Downs/AMC</p></figcaption></figure><p>After 11 seasons and 12 years, &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; aired its final episode this year, with many fans who have since turned away from the show returning for the finale.</p><p>The episode &#34;Rest in Peace&#34; was a satisfying ending to the series: bringing back fan favorites like Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and Michonne (Danai Gurira) and closing the loops on unfinished storylines.</p><p><a href="https://www.insider.com/the-walking-dead-finale-review-2022-11">Insider&#39;s &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; expert Kirsten Acuna</a> noted that the series finale was not perfect since it didn&#39;t feel like a &#34;complete conclusion&#34; with multiple spin-offs of the show in the works.</p><p>But the finale still had multiple stand-out scenes including a heart-to-heart between Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) that had been a long time coming since the latter killed the former&#39;s husband Glenn in season seven.</p></div><div class="slide">The &#34;Severance&#34; season one finale will keep you perpetually on the edge of your seats, holding your breath.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/620ed9d3462ff20019c5987b?format=jpeg" height="4000" width="5333" charset="" alt="Adam Scott and Britt Lower in â€œSeverance&#34;"/><figcaption>Adam Scott and Britt Lower discover the truth in the &#34;Severance&#34; season one finale.<p class="copyright">Apple TV</p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.insider.com/severance-adam-scott-apple-tv-series-review-2022-2">&#34;Severance&#34; may be one of the best thrillers of the year</a> and part of this reason is its jaw-dropping finale. The Apple TV+ series follows a group of office employees whose brain gets split in two separating their work consciousness and memories from their consciousness and memories outside of work.</p><p>In &#34;The We We Are,&#34; the Innies (the name of the work persona) discover there&#39;s a way to turn on that personality while outside work. They hatch a plan to do so to reveal the cruelty of the company. However, instead, they each find out world-shifting information about their true lives.</p><p>The episode does not only leave the audience shocked but constantly nervous as you wonder whether the Innies will get the truth out before they&#39;re stopped.</p><p>Then the episode leaves you on an exasperating cliffhanger where Mark (Adam Scott) tries to reveal the truth to his sister before the screen turns black.</p></div><div class="slide">&#34;Derry Girls&#34; ended with a sentimental message of hope and child-like innocence.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63a04a150675db0018b36106?format=jpeg" height="832" width="1109" charset="" alt="derry girls"/><figcaption>Earlier this year fans said goodbye to the &#34;Derry Girls&#34; characters.<p class="copyright">Netflix</p></figcaption></figure><p>After two amazing, hilarious seasons, <a href="https://www.insider.com/what-is-derry-girls-about-2019-1">&#34;Derry Girls&#34;</a> creator Lisa McGee made the shocking announcement that the third season would be the last of the series. <a href="https://twitter.com/LisaMMcGee/status/1440985114016628739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1440985114016628739%7Ctwgr%5E309db7e613a3ca2973c2d842be3863e8cd4a532d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.distractify.com%2Fp%2Fwhy-is-derry-girls-ending">McGee said in her statement in 2021</a> that she always meant to make three seasons and the timing works as the stars begin to get other roles (Nicola Coughlan, for instance, now stars in &#34;Bridgerton&#34;).</p><p>&#34;Derry Girls&#34; ends in a transformational period not just for the four main characters but also for Ireland as a whole, which is apt for the teen sitcom about life in the Troubles &ndash; a 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland in the 20th century about the country&#39;s independence.</p><p>The country is finally getting the opportunity to decide its fate with the Good Friday agreement referendum, while at the same time the girls are considering their future as they turn 18. The finale finds a good balance between the humor and the character&#39;s realization of what the end of The Troubles might mean.&nbsp;</p><p>While it may seem more politically focused than other episodes, it still feels centered on the girl&#39;s friendship and the innocence and hope of being a teenager. It is an abrupt end, but a happy one.</p></div><div class="slide">&#34;Moon Knight&#34; has a messy ending that needed more episodes to pull off.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/627a585794a2c10018eebb40?format=jpeg" height="1261" width="1682" charset="" alt="Moon Knight"/><figcaption>A post-credit scene in &#34;Moon Knight&#34; introduces a new character, Jake Lockley.<p class="copyright">Disney+ / Marvel Studios</p></figcaption></figure><p>Episodes four and five of &#34;Moon Knight&#34; may be the best episodes of the limited series. They completely reshift our knowledge of what has been real in the show thus far while allowing <a href="https://www.insider.com/moon-knight-cast-marvel-show-2022-3">Moon Knight&#39;s main alters Steven Grant and Marc Spector</a> (both played by Oscar Isaac) to come to terms with their shared history and communicate properly.</p><p>The problem with this is that this was followed by the season finale &#34;Gods and Monsters&#34; which tries to tie together several different story threads in a nice little bow.</p><p>Isaac&#39;s performance as Moon Knight is still impressive and Layla&#39;s (May Calamawy) transformation into a superhero, the first Arab superhero, was inspiring. However, everything else in the finale felt lackluster.</p><p>What was most disappointing was the post-credit scene introducing Jake Lockley, Moon Knight&#39;s third main alter.</p><p>The show had been teasing him throughout but without confirmation of a second season, this addition does not make sense and really undermines the series&#39; attempts to portray <a href="https://www.insider.com/moon-knight-gets-right-and-wrong-dissociative-identity-disorder-2022-5">dissociative identity disorder sensitively.</a></p></div><div class="slide">&#34;She-Hulk: Attorney At Law&#34; fails to land its final joke.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6356bf30ffcac3001876f202?format=jpeg" height="1083" width="1445" charset="" alt="Tatiana Maslany as She-Hulk walking into the production office."/><figcaption>Tatiana Maslany as She-Hulk walking into the production office.<p class="copyright">Marvel Studios</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;She-Hulk: Attorney At Law&#34; is another series with a disappointing ending despite its promising start.</p><p>&#34;Whose Show is This&#34; appears to follow the standard Marvel ending, setting up the big final battle between good and evil. However, this was part of the finale&#39;s big joke, which shows She-Hulk literally breaking through your screen to change the story of the finale.</p><p>She confronts K.E.V.I.N, based on Marvel President Kevin Feige, and shares critiques that have been said before for previous Marvel adaptations. While the wall-breaking is great and the funniest part of the episode, the series does not provide an alternate idea for an ending.</p><p>Instead, we return to the aftermath of what would have been the final battle and essentially just carry out the same Marvel tropes as everything else.</p><p>If the whole moment was meant to show that the old way is no longer working, the series does not provide an entertaining alternative.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">Some critics called the &#34;Killing Eve&#34; series finale the worst ending since &#34;Game of Thrones.&#34;<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5eba9abe42278d5e8a5f9598?format=jpeg" height="813" width="1083" charset="" alt="killing eve"/><figcaption>The series ended with one of the main characters dead and the other in mourning.<p class="copyright">BBC America</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ending a series is always a difficult task of balancing fans&#39; satisfaction while following the story plan to the end. Unfortunately, &#34;Killing Eve&#34; decided to ignore fans&#39; love for Eve (Sandra Oh) and Villanelle (Jodie Comer).</p><p>In &#34;Hello, Losers,&#34; after the pair finally defeat their enemies and kiss for the first time, Villanelle is shot and killed and Eve is left to cry over her death.</p><p>Not only does the scene contribute to the harmful &#34;bury your gays&#34; trope &mdash; the idea that queer characters are often killed off in series as acts of martyrdom &mdash; but even Luke Jennings, the author who wrote the book the series is based on, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/killing-eve-writer-tv-finale">criticized this decision publicly since the book ends with the pair living happily together.</a></p><p>Inverse even dubbed the ending as <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/killing-eve-series-finale-ending-backlash-explained">one of the worst TV finales since &#34;Game of Thrones.&#34;&nbsp;</a></p></div><div class="slide">The &#34;Riverdale&#34; season finale was one of the most bizarre TV episodes ever created.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63a18e7eb5600000185b76ab?format=jpeg" height="1080" width="1440" charset="" alt="RIverdale"/><figcaption>The scene of Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch) using her Phoenix powers to stop a comet was ridiculed on social media earlier this year.<p class="copyright">The CW</p></figcaption></figure><p>The season six finale may not be the worst season finale of &#34;Riverdale,&#34; but every new episode at this point is one of the most bizarre stories ever put on-screen.</p><p>In &#34;Chapter One Hundred and Seventeen: Night of the Comet,&#34; the characters try and come up with a way to stop a comet from hitting the town and destroying it. Oh, and they have powers now in case you dropped off before the sixth season.</p><p>It is decided that Cheryl Blossom will use her &#34;Phoenix powers&#34; to burn the comet from the inside.</p><p>However, in perfect &#34;Riverdale&#34; fashion, this is a secondary plot point for 90% of the episode.</p><p>Instead, the finale centers on some pretty good character growth: Veronica finally found her purpose, Archie accepted he cannot save everyone and Betty was finally ready to give up her darkness and focus on the light.</p><p>There were also some really bad plot points such as the ancestors of Cheryl and Toni possessing their bodies to have sex with each other one more time, and Veronica using her poisoning powers as a &#34;human dialysis&#34; to transfer the main character&#39;s life force into Cheryl.</p><p>This episode almost felt like the end of the show before I realized we still have an entire season coming. This means &#34;Riverdale&#34; was about to do what it does best: come up with a logically impossible, and dumb plot twist to justify its seemingly endless plot.</p><p>Cheryl destroys the comet but in doing so sends the town back in time, removing any growth from characters and every plot point of the last six seasons.</p><p>It is almost a genius tactic to allow anyone to tune in for the final season but an aggravating revelation for those who have kept up with the show.</p></div><div class="slide">&#34;The Sex Lives of College Girls&#34; season two finale has divided its audience.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63a09fa0b5600000185b526b?format=jpeg" height="1417" width="1890" charset="" alt="ReneÃ© Rapp and Pauline Chalamet on season two of &#34;The Sex Lives of College Girls.&#34;"/><figcaption>ReneÃ© Rapp and Pauline Chalamet on season two of &#34;The Sex Lives of College Girls.&#34;<p class="copyright">HBO Max</p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.insider.com/sex-lives-of-college-girls-season-2-finale-showrunner-interview-2022-12">&#34;The Sex Lives of College Girls&#34; season two finale</a> was a wild ride to watch and has divided fans due to the handling of all of the main characters.</p><p>Halfway through &#34;The Rooming Lottery,&#34; it seemed that the four girls were about to choose to live together and stay friends.</p><p>By the end, the exact opposite seemed closer to the truth due to rapid storytelling.</p><p>Many fans take issue with Kimberly (Pauline Chalamet) going behind Whitney&#39;s (Alyah Chanelle Scott) back to have a makeout session with her ex Canaan (Christopher Meyer). While this is arguably typical of Kimberly&#39;s behavior &mdash; she did sleep with Leighton&#39;s (ReneÃ© Rapp) brother behind her back in the first season &mdash; the pair&#39;s romantic feelings for each other seemingly came out of nowhere.</p><p>Plus, Whitney has been through enough terrible relationships in the first two seasons to get the short end of the stick again.</p><p>Bela realizing that she&#39;s the problem has been a long time coming. However, it is weird that, just as she makes this realization and seems ready to accept it, she decides to run away from her problems by moving schools.</p><p>Meanwhile, Leighton (ReneÃ© Rapp) finally shows some personal growth by removing her judgemental ways.</p><p>However, the 180-degree turn from dating Tatum (Gracie Dzienny), who was pushing Leighton back, to going back to Alicia (Midori Francis), who was instrumental in the character&#39;s growth, happened so quickly that some fans didn&#39;t even know that the former pair had broken up.</p><p>The combination of these four stories leaves no viewer happy and a lot of messy storylines to fix in season three.</p></div></div><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.insider.com/best-and-worst-season-finales-this-year-2022-12">Insider</a></div>]]>

The easiest and most popular method is for brands to add a rainbow flag component to their profile images or share a post announcing their support of the LGBTQ community.</p><p>However, every year, there is one gesture that is mostly inoffensive but completely misses the mark. In 2019, a UK-based supermarket sold an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/marks-and-spencer-lgbt-sandwich-receives-mixed-reactions-2019-5">&#34;LGBT sandwich,&#34;</a> which stood for the ingredients lettuce, guacamole, bacon, and tomato, and packaged it with a rainbow label.

The German agency behind the idea, Jung von Matt Donau, said the gesture represented &#34;equal love and equal rights.&#34;</p><p>Not only did the move fall flat, but members of the LGBTQ community pointed out that it <a href="https://twitter.com/mattxiv/status/1532901164697665536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1532901164697665536%7Ctwgr%5Eab6fc8fe81ac950465a5f4999b0539cf88232df1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fburger-king-austria-ad-agency-apologizes-pride-whopper-campaign-2022-6">gestures at </a>some sexual innuendo. Jung von Matt Donau then apologized for the campaign and said it would do a better job consulting the LGBTQ community for future brand imagery.</p><p>&#34;Our strongest concern is if we offended members of the LGBTQ community with this campaign,&#34; the agency said in a post shared on LinkedIn. &#34;We&#39;ve learned our lessons and will include experts on communicating with the LGBTQ community for future work as promoting equal love and equal rights will still be a priority for us.&#34;</p></div><div class="slide">Duolingo&#39;s Amber Heard TikTok comment<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/639a499027c0a700193e32d8?format=jpeg" height="2362" width="3149" charset="" alt="Hand holding phone with Duolingo home screen."/><figcaption>Duolingo waded into the Johnny Depp v.

Tony Piloseno was a college student at the time, working part-time at a store in Ohio. He grew hundreds of thousands of followers by creating soothing videos of himself mixing different paint colors. He then pitched some of his social media strategies to Sherwin-Williams&#39; headquarters.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did they turn his ideas down, but they also turned their nose at him for using company resources during work hours. The company terminated Piloseno&#39;s job. The backlash against the paint company at the time worked in his favor, however, and he soon launched his own line of paint that was well-received by the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Two years later, he received a notification on TikTok that Sherwin-Williams had finally created a brand page, which he was tickled by. Sherwin-Williams employees told Insider under anonymity that they thought it was a little too late for the brand to get on board &mdash; and their content wasn&#39;t as creative as what Piloseno offered.</p><p>&#34;Sherwin is trying to keep up [but] they&#39;re a little behind,&#34; an employee said in March. &#34;People related to Tony&#39;s more because it was like watching a friend instead of him trying to sell you something. He was trying to build a culture around paint, like, this is how you make it, this is what makes paint fun.&#34;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">Tampax&#39;s off-color menstruation joke<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/639a48deb7e0f200180919c6?format=jpeg" height="4000" width="5333" charset="" alt="Two boxes of Tampax Pearl tampons are seen on a shelf at a store in Washington, DC, on June 14, 2022"/><figcaption>Tampax said it &#34;refused to let Twitter shut down&#34; before sharing a wildly racy tweet.<p class="copyright">STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>In late November, Tampax tweeted a racy joke about its flagship product: &#34;You&#39;re in their DMs. We&#39;re in them.

			<title>Christian Siriano is getting tired of sheer fashion and says covered-up looks can be just as sexy</title>

<li>Christian Siriano is ready for new takes on the beloved &#34;naked&#34; fashion trend.</li>
<li>He told Insider that, instead of beaded, sheer dresses, he&#39;d like to see &#34;understated elegance.&#34;</li>
<li>Siriano also said he thinks &#34;covered-up&#34; looks can be equally &#34;sexy.&#34;</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://www.insider.com/wildest-sheer-outfits-celebrities-have-ever-worn-2021-9">Sheer fashion</a> is bigger than a typical trend &mdash; it&#39;s more like <a href="https://www.insider.com/kendall-jenner-talks-about-see-through-shirt-2022-9">a red-carpet rite of passage</a>.

When asked about style trends for 2023, Siriano said he&#39;s hoping to see more &#34;understated elegance&#34; in fashion.</p><p>But to do so, he said, we might have to say goodbye to the sheer, beaded dresses we&#39;ve become accustomed to.</p><p>&#34;There was the sheer, sexy thing for <em>so long</em> but I&#39;m like, we&#39;ve seen it,&#34; he said.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63a0806bb5600000185b485c?format=jpeg" height="1998" width="1598" charset="" alt="Christian Siriano at the Elegant White Elephant Exchange in New York City on December 13."/><figcaption>Christian Siriano at the Elegant White Elephant Exchange in New York City on December 13.<p class="copyright">Cassidy Sparrow</p></figcaption></figure><p>Siriano doesn&#39;t want see-through gowns and outfits to disappear altogether.

Are we still in our athleisure, or are we now in the 2000s? Or are we going glam? Like, what are we doing?&#39;&#34;</p><p>But now, according to Siriano, we have a chance to &#34;return to glamour,&#34; something he&#39;s already seeing ahead of 2023.</p><p>&#34;People are throwing back on a beautiful jacket or a great pair of heels. I have seen that a lot, and I love it,&#34; he said. &#34;I think it&#39;s nice that vibe is still happening.&#34;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.insider.com/christian-siriano-talks-about-sheer-fashion-trend-2022-12">Insider</a></div>]]>

			<title>After having our 2nd child, my husband and I decided one of us should stay home. Since I made more money, he became a stay-at-home dad.</title>
			<link>https://www.insider.com/dad-became-stay-home-parent-after-birth-of-second-child-2022-12</link>
			<description>The author shares how putting two kids in day care would&#39;ve left the couple with little extra money, so the dad decided to stay with the kids.</description>

<li>My husband and I spent our first seven years of marriage building our careers.</li>
<li>When our second child was born, we realized how expensive day care would be.</li>
<li>My husband decided to stay at home with the kids, and I grew my career &mdash; and our family thrives.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Sixteen years ago, my husband and I decided to make a big shift for our family.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter and I had spent the first seven years of our married life without kids, supporting each other in our separate career goals. When our son was born, we continued to balance it all, but when we welcomed our daughter almost three years later, the reality hit us.</p><p>We now had two children under the age of 3 and two demanding career paths &mdash; his as a classically trained chef who never had weekends or holidays off, and mine as a creative-agency founder just getting her company off the ground.</p><p>On top of this, we discovered that day-care costs for two were not cheap. As we considered our options, we recalled what my husband said jokingly when we became parents: &#34;Whoever is making more money goes back to work.&#34;</p><p>Back then, I knew in a flash that would be me and I would love that. With our daughter&#39;s arrival, it felt like time to revisit the thought.&nbsp;</p><p>When we talked it over seriously, things came into perspective. We realized that in paying for day care for two, we&#39;d be making only about $10,000 more a year by having two incomes. I knew I could find a way to fill that gap. And if Peter, who had always been a hands-on, nurturing parent, became a stay-at-home dad, the kids would have an incredible experience. It made sense.</p><p>So we did it and it&#39;s been amazing. Here is some of what we&#39;ve learned.</p><h2><strong>A commitment to partnership and learning is key</strong></h2><p>Neither of us stagnates. We&#39;ve made it a priority to keep evolving alongside each other, pushing each other and setting challenges that make us better individually and as a family.</p><p>We don&#39;t ask each other to grow at the same rates or in the same areas, but we do ask each other to prioritize personal development.</p><h2><strong>Nothing is ever perfect</strong></h2><p>Part of my own growth has been letting go of my style of perfection and recognizing a different perfection. I can&#39;t expect my husband to do things exactly like I would all the time. But at the end of the day, the kids are happy, and that&#39;s what we care about.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A certain amount of money is necessary, but we didn&#39;t need as much as we thought</strong></h2><p>We found early on that we didn&#39;t need large amounts of disposable income to make it work &mdash; but we did have to make some financial changes and sort through what we did and didn&#39;t need. This perspective served us well over the years, even as my income grew.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#39;m thankful we could make the financial stretch, and I realize not all families have this option. I think it&#39;s also true, though, that many families may not consider it when it may be a realistic possibility.</p><h2><strong>Thinking outside the societal box can open up your life</strong></h2><p>It&#39;s often assumed that if someone is going to stay home with the kids, it will be the mom. But in our family, we&#39;ve discovered there&#39;s a spectacular power in it being the dad who stays at home. I haven&#39;t lost anything in my relationship with my kids through continuing to work &mdash; there&#39;s a special connection we have as mothers that can&#39;t easily be replaced.</p><p>Being the sole breadwinner in the family has also taught me as a woman and entrepreneur to fully advocate for myself. My job doesn&#39;t simply backfill my spouse&#39;s salary, so I don&#39;t treat it that way. I show up without compromise, and that&#39;s fueled my career trajectory.</p><p>I&#39;m thankful we decided to take on this challenge together and make space for a stay-at-home dad in our family. While our path may be a less common choice, it&#39;s been a powerful one for us.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.insider.com/dad-became-stay-home-parent-after-birth-of-second-child-2022-12">Insider</a></div>]]>

I stayed at a hotel in the center of <a href="https://www.floridashistoriccoast.com/things-to-do/history/historic-district/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">St. Augustine&#39;s Historic District</a>, which overlooks the Matanzas River and the iconic Bridge of Lions.</p><p>I arrived early in the day and spent the afternoon and evening exploring the town&#39;s gorgeous cobblestone streets, European-inspired architecture, and festive Christmas displays. Here are my top takeaways from the trip.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">I thought St. Augustine&#39;s Historic District felt like an old-world European city.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa4fad47bbe40019836060?format=jpeg" height="3322" width="4429" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>There were informational signs throughout the Historic District.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>St. Augustine was founded <a href="https://www.citystaug.com/693/Our-History#:~:text=Founded%20in%201565%2C%20St.,the%20Spanish%20established%20at%20St." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">in 1565</a> and is considered America&#39;s longest-occupied city. It has a rich history with a mix of cultural influences, from its Spanish founders and 18th century British rulers, to the <a href="https://www.floridashistoriccoast.com/things-to-do/history/flaglers-gilded-age/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Gilded Age tycoons</a> who transformed it into a tourist destination with newly built resorts and hotels, and the many others who&#39;ve called it home ever since.</p><p>The town&#39;s European influences were, in my opinion, most prominent in its architecture and layout.</p></div><div class="slide">Strolling through the Historic District, I saw colorful signs and stucco walls, potted flowers, and narrow brick streets.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa5e3e47bbe40019836135?format=jpeg" height="3372" width="4496" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>The buildings throughout St. Augustine were quaint and inviting.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>Throughout St. Augustine&#39;s Historic District, I saw colorful shutters, balconies overflowing with potted flowers, and vibrant terracotta roofs.</p><p>I was especially impressed by the variety of unique doors I saw on homes and businesses, including wooden doors, wrought iron doors, and doors of all shapes and colors. I could fill an album with all the photos I took of St. Augustine&#39;s doors &mdash; I took a lot because I thought they were so beautiful.</p><p>I also enjoyed reading various signs and plaques posted throughout the city that identified historic landmarks and told stories about the town&#39;s past. One sign I saw on King Street described how American Patriots had been held <a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=46802" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">as prisoners of war</a> in St. Augustine during the American Revolution.</p></div><div class="slide">I thought the holiday decorations enhanced St. Augustine&#39;s village-like charm.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa547d47bbe400198360a6?format=jpeg" height="3360" width="4480" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>Holiday decorations outside of a restaurant in St. Augustine.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>From the moment I arrived, I marveled at the holiday decorations that seemed to fill every corner of the city. At my hotel, the banisters leading to my room were wrapped in ribbons and garland, and large ornaments hung from the breezeway ceilings.</p><p>Around town, I saw wreaths hung from street lamps and business facades decorated with string lights and red poinsettias. I passed by an art gallery that had a Grinch-themed exhibit, and shops along the busy foot-trafficked King Street that had filled their windows and walls with holiday displays.</p><p>One boutique I visited, called <a href="https://www.shoptwosparrows.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Two Sparrows,</a> invited customers to write holiday messages or prayers on blank tags and hang them on a Christmas tree in the center of the store.</p><p>Even the passersby added to the charm of the season. I spotted folks donning Santa hats, matching holiday-themed outfits, and a variety of ugly and not-so-ugly Christmas sweaters.</p></div><div class="slide">After checking into my hotel, I walked to the Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n, a grassy square in the center of town where I saw lots of people and families taking photos.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa527447bbe40019836078?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="4608" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>There was a large tree in the Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>Once I&#39;d checked in at my hotel, I took a six-minute walk to the Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n. In this rectangular plaza, which <a href="https://www.visitstaugustine.com/thing-to-do/plaza-de-la-constitucion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">dates back to 1573</a>, I saw several historical gems, from Civil War-era cannons to the <a href="https://www.floridashistoriccoast.com/blog/the-plaza-de-la-constitucion/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">ConstituciÃ³n Monument</a>, an early-1800s obelisk that was built in honor of the Spanish government.</p><p>The square was also a hub for the Nights of Lights festivities. At the center of the plaza, I came across a large Christmas tree and a raised pavilion, where a chorus of children were singing holiday hymns.</p><p>At the eastern end of the square, closest to the Matanzas River, I saw craftspeople and artists selling wares at a covered market, which I later read online dates <a href="https://www.visitstaugustine.com/thing-to-do/plaza-de-la-constitucion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">back to the 1500s</a>. Throughout the square, I saw families lounging in portable camp chairs and snapping photos in front of the many festive decorations.</p></div><div class="slide">I learned more about St. Augustine by exploring the historic buildings surrounding the plaza.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa569246a5550018b7f1f7?format=jpeg" height="1944" width="2593" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>At the courtyard inside the Lightner Museum.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>After visiting the plaza, I explored some of the buildings that surround the square, including the historic <a href="https://www.visitstaugustine.com/thing-to-do/governors-house-cultural-center-and-museum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Governor&#39;s House Cultural Center</a> and the <a href="https://www.visitstaugustine.com/thing-to-do/cathedral-basilica-st-augustine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine</a>.</p><p>I also went through <a href="https://lightnermuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">the Lightner Museum</a>, which has art and history exhibits, and stopped to take photos outside of Ponce de LÃ©on Hall at <a href="https://www.flagler.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Flagler College</a>, a liberal arts school.</p><p>Both&nbsp;the Lightner Museum and Ponce de LÃ©on Hall were constructed during the Gilded Age and once served as the luxurious <a href="https://lightnermuseum.org/history-alcazar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Alcazar</a> and <a href="https://www.flagler.edu/about-flagler/history/hotel-ponce-de-leon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Ponce de LÃ©on</a> hotels for well-to-do tourists.</p></div><div class="slide">I admired the architecture of Flagler College&#39;s Ponce de LÃ©on Hall.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa589646a5550018b7f211?format=jpeg" height="3398" width="4530" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>The entrance to Flagler College, a liberal arts college in St. Augustine.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>I stopped outside Ponce de LÃ©on Hall, which was once a luxury hotel and <a href="https://www.flagler.edu/student-life/living-on-campus/residence-halls/ponce-de-leon-hall/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">is now a residence hall</a> for Flager College, according to the school&#39;s website. I paused to take a Polaroid for a young couple who said they were also visiting from out of town and wanted a picture in front of the building.</p><p>Built <a href="https://www.flagler.edu/about-flagler/history/hotel-ponce-de-leon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">in the 1880s</a>, the Hall has arched walkways that surround a large courtyard, concrete towers with intricate moldings, terracotta roofing, and stately brick columns, including two by the main gates that had carvings of lions&#39; heads. I also saw the statue of Henry Flagler, who developed the original hotel, in front of the gated entrance.</p></div><div class="slide">I read about the political and cultural history of St. Augustine at the Governor&#39;s House Cultural Center and Museum.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa5a5047bbe400198360fa?format=jpeg" height="3429" width="4572" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>Inside the Governor&#39;s House Cultural Center and Museum.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>At the <a href="http://staugustine.ufl.edu/visit.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored">Governor&#39;s House Cultural Center and Museum</a>, a single L-shaped building that spans the width of the plaza and once housed colonial governors, I found glass displays containing historical items and informational plaques about the history of the town. I read details about how St. Augustine&#39;s architectural makeup evolved over the centuries since its founding and was influenced by its various governments, including Spanish and British rulers.</p><p>In the building&#39;s lobby, I saw a permanent exhibit of artifacts from the building&#39;s renovations over the years, and in the center of the building there were rooms for rotating art exhibits.</p></div><div class="slide">I didn&#39;t get a chance to see inside the&nbsp;Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine since it was closed to the public for a private wedding.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa5c1847bbe4001983611a?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="4608" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>Outside the Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>I didn&#39;t go inside the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.visitstaugustine.com/thing-to-do/cathedral-basilica-st-augustine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine</a> because it was temporarily closed to the public for a wedding ceremony. But I did get a chance to walk around the building and read about its history.</p><p>One sign that I saw explained how the site dates back to a Catholic mass that was held in 1565, an event that&#39;s considered <a href="https://www.floridashistoriccoast.com/blog/historic-churches-in-the-nations-oldest-city/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">the first mass</a> ever held in the continental United States.</p></div><div class="slide">I most enjoyed the Lightner Museum because its architecture reminded me of a castle.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa5b0f46a5550018b7f22f?format=jpeg" height="3364" width="4485" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>Outside the Lightner Museum.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://lightnermuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Lightner Museum</a> had castle-like towers, arched corridors with stone columns, and walkways that led to an inner courtyard. I later learned, after browsing the museum website, that these elements are a combination of <a href="https://lightnermuseum.org/history-alcazar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Italian Renaissance and Moorish architecture</a>.</p><p>As I explored the grassy grounds around the museum, I saw a wedding party passing through, with bridesmaids who wore elegant red and green gowns. I noticed that other nearby visitors, like me, took care to stay a respectful distance from the wedding group, which to me emphasized the feeling of friendliness I experienced throughout the town.</p></div><div class="slide">I enjoyed strolling along St. George Street, a pedestrian-only area brimming with interesting shops, restaurants, and courtyards.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa56be47bbe400198360cb?format=jpeg" height="3388" width="5083" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>St. George Street was filled with unique shops and restaurants.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>Completely off-limits to vehicles, <a href="https://www.floridashistoriccoast.com/blog/discover-whats-st-george-street/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">St. George Street</a> is lined with shops and restaurants, many of which are set in two-story buildings with balconies. In between the buildings, I also saw several quaint gardens and courtyards. The architecture here to me seemed much simpler and more understated than what I&#39;d seen around the Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n.</p><p>For example, the balconies that I saw were mostly built with wood rather than stone, many of the roofs had wooden shingles instead of terracotta tiles, and the buildings overall were more simple and less elaborate. Combined with the foot traffic and brick streets, the area had a pleasant vibe that felt to me like strolling through a European village or market.</p><p>One of the larger courtyards I came across along St. George had a coffee shop and beer tavern, and was filled with families gathered at outdoor patio tables. I also saw gift shops that lined the courtyard, including a jewelry shop and a store that sold Florida-themed souvenirs. At one end of the square, kids lined up to meet and take photos with a festively dressed Santa and Mrs. Claus.</p></div><div class="slide">After dusk, millions of lights transformed the town into a twinkling holiday wonderland.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa577247bbe400198360df?format=jpeg" height="2369" width="3159" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>The Nights of Lights holiday decorations throughout St. Augustine.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>As the light displays switched on at sunset, I saw the town transform into a glowing spectacle that I thought looked like something right out of a children&#39;s holiday book.</p><p>I made a point to circle back to the Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n just after dusk, and I&#39;m glad I did. The trees in the park were lit up with string lights that draped over the square like a canopy and twinkled on and off in a coordinated display. The Christmas tree at the center of the plaza, which had been off when I passed by during the day, glowed with multi-colored lights.</p><p>I saw families and couples lined up patiently at the edge of a gazebo near the tree, which had an elevated, well-lit platform that was a convenient place for taking photos with holiday lights in the background.</p><p>At the plaza&#39;s artisan market, I saw a lone guitarist softly strumming Vince Guaraldi&#39;s &#34;Skating.&#34; The guitar music drifted across the park and mingled with children&#39;s laughter and church bells from the Cathedral Basilica, which reminded me of attending midnight mass on Christmas Eve with my family when I was a child.</p><p>I currently live a few hours away from my hometown and don&#39;t get to spend many holidays with my family, so it felt comforting to be surrounded by so many cheerful people celebrating together.</p></div><div class="slide">Even with its European-inspired charm, I thought St. Augustine still had a delightful and quirky Florida flair.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa5b4246a5550018b7f239?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="4608" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>I saw unique mermaid-themed ornaments in the window of a gift shop.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who&#39;s lived in Florida for over a decade, I&#39;m rather fond of the state&#39;s notorious weirdness, and was amused to see some of it throughout St. Augustine&#39;s mostly European-inspired settings.</p><p>On St. George Street, I spotted mermaid Christmas ornaments and other tropical eccentricities on display in shop windows. And on multiple occasions, I passed people dressed in full pirate garb, with sashes, swords, and hats and all. I presumed they were on their way to or from the <a href="https://www.thepiratemuseum.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Pirate &amp; Treasure Museum</a>, which is fittingly located across from the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/casa/learn/the-founding-of-castillo-de-san-marcos.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Castillo de San Marcos Monument</a>, a historic coquina fort, built in 1695, that was constructed in part to protect the town from marauders.</p></div><div class="slide">I took a nighttime walk across the Bridge of Lions, and enjoyed every step.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa5d7146a5550018b7f248?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="4608" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>The Bridge of Lions with St. Augustine&#39;s holiday lights in the background.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.visitstaugustine.com/thing-to-do/bridge-lions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Bridge of Lions</a>, which is named for the two pairs of carved marble lions that guard its entrances, connects St. Augustine&#39;s mainland with <a href="https://www.visitstaugustine.com/regions/anastasia-island" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Anastasia Island</a>, a beach community across the Matanzas River.</p><p>The bridge has a raised sidewalk and is pedestrian-friendly, so I decided to stroll partway across the river after sunset to view the holiday festivities from a distance.</p><p>On my walk, I watched the boats in the <a href="https://www.citystaug.com/798/Municipal-Marina">marina</a>, some of which were decorated with colorful lights, and admired the sights and sounds of Nights of Lights, which I could still hear from afar.</p><p>The lights illuminated the evening and cast twinkling, multi-colored reflections on the water. From the bridge, I could hear passengers on the <a href="https://www.trolleytours.com/st-augustine">Old Town Trolley Tours</a>, St. Augustine&#39;s popular shuttle service, singing Christmas carols like &#34;Feliz Navidad&#34; and &#34;Rockin&#39; Around the Christmas Tree.&#34;</p></div><div class="slide">As the evening wore on, I thought the Nights of Lights festivities felt notably more rowdy and raucous.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6369cadf113fe1001834efbc?format=jpeg" height="2944" width="3925" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Night of Lights holiday travel courtesy FloridasHistoricCoast.com"/><figcaption>A horse-drawn carriage at the Night of Lights Festival in St. Augustine.<p class="copyright">FloridasHistoricCoast.com</p></figcaption></figure><p>I say this not with the heart of a Grinch, but with a hopefully helpful nod to traveling parents and early risers: While the daytime festivities felt completely family-friendly to me, the after-dark hours of Nights of Lights felt distinctly adult.</p><p>An hour or two after sunset, I noticed that the bar-hopping crowd expanded into many of the streets around the city, which made the sidewalks more dense and raucous than they&#39;d been when I was walking around during the day.</p><p>The bars were packed, with loud music that I could hear long after I returned to my hotel around 11 p.m. The vibe around town continued to feel upbeat though, and from my perspective the area never felt unsafe, even in the later hours of the night.</p></div><div class="slide">The crowds were intense during the holidays, so if you&#39;re visiting this time of year, I think it&#39;s important to plan ahead for parking and dining.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa5b7b47bbe4001983610d?format=jpeg" height="1892" width="2523" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>Next time, I plan to visit St. Augustine during a non-holiday season.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>I&#39;m glad I experienced the festivities, but my next visit to St. Augustine will likely be during the off-season instead of in December. After arriving in town, I quickly realized how busy it gets this time of year due to the tourists who visit for the holiday lights and celebrations.</p><p>I saw multiple parking garages and a few outdoor lots throughout the Historic District, but many were already full by the time I got into town in the early afternoon. I was thankful I opted for a hotel near the center of the city that had reserved parking spots where I could park my car. Luckily, my hotel was also within walking distance of the main sites, otherwise I think getting around would likely have been a burden.</p><p>During the day, I wasn&#39;t bothered by the number of people roaming the streets, since everyone was so friendly and the town is built to accommodate walkers with pedestrian-only areas and clearly marked crosswalks. But in the evening, the crowds made it difficult to find a spot to eat or drink.</p><p>Starting just before sunset, nearly every restaurant I passed &mdash; including places that only offered food to go, like ice cream parlors or coffee shops &mdash; had lines that stretched out the door. At one particularly popular restaurant, I counted 39 people waiting outside the building.</p><p>As a solo traveler, I was fortunate to squeeze into a single bar seat outside at <a href="https://casamayasta.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Casa Maya</a>, a Mexican restaurant and bar, where I enjoyed a shrimp and guajillo dish that was delicious. But next time, I&#39;ll call ahead to the restaurants I want to visit and make a reservation.</p></div><div class="slide">I concluded my trip with a quiet early-morning stroll and breakfast at a French bakery.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aa57db46a5550018b7f209?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="4608" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>Macarons and coffee from French bakery Le Macaron.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>On my last morning in town, I woke up early and enjoyed a stroll around the quiet, not-yet-bustling brick streets. At this time of day, just after sunrise, I thought St. Augustine took on a more local feel. The sidewalks were occupied mostly by neighborhood folks walking their dogs or by restaurant workers prepping for the day.</p><p>I walked along the river again, and stopped to watch the boats in the now-foggy marina wait for their turn to pass under the drawbridge.</p><p>I considered stopping at a popular breakfast spot along Avenida Menendez, another main thoroughfare, but realized that other early risers in town had already congregated there. Since I wanted to avoid long lines, I opted instead to wait until a French bakery, <a href="https://lemacaron-us.com/locations/st-augustine-cathedral-place/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Le Macaron</a>, opened at 10 a.m., and enjoyed a breakfast of macarons and coffee at its booths that overlooked the river.</p></div><div class="slide">With its European-influenced cobblestone streets and immersive holiday displays, St. Augustine proved to be a cheery weekend getaway.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63aac74246a5550018b7f7c8?format=jpeg" height="2316" width="3088" charset="" alt="St. Augustine Florida Alison Datko"/><figcaption>St. Augustine made for a fun weekend getaway.<p class="copyright">Alison Datko</p></figcaption></figure><p>As a Florida resident, I sometimes long to experience Christmastime like they do in storybooks &mdash; bundled up in the snow, serenaded by Christmas carols, and surrounded by over-the-top baubles and decor.</p><p>While there wasn&#39;t any snow, I thought St. Augustine&#39;s holiday displays, friendly crowds, and cheery atmosphere made for a wonderful solo getaway. And I was more than happy to trade the snow flurries in my imagination for palm trees and a serene, twinkling riverfront.</p></div></div><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.insider.com/visiting-st-augustine-florida-weekend-getaway-european-inspired-city-2022-12">Insider</a></div>]]>

<li>Japan will soon start requiring a negative COVID test upon arrival for travelers from China.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Japan only recently reopened its borders to tourists in October.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>As China&#39;s COVID cases soar, Japan is preparing to roll out special requirements for travelers arriving from mainland China.</p><p>On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that all travelers coming into Japan from China will be required to produce a negative COVID test upon arrival, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-require-negative-covid-test-upon-arrival-chinese-travellers-fnn-2022-12-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported Reuters.</a> Those who test positive will have to quarantine for a week in a designated <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3204657/coronavirus-japan-limit-china-flight-increase-test-travellers-upon-arrival">facility</a>.</p><p>&#34;Concern has been growing in Japan as it is difficult to grasp the detailed situation,&#34; Kishida said, <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2022/12/c632b693d10c-breaking-news-japan-to-require-covid-tests-for-travelers-from-china-kishida.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per local news agency Kyodo News.</a></p><p>Kishida also <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3204657/coronavirus-japan-limit-china-flight-increase-test-travellers-upon-arrival">said</a> Toyko will be implementing a cap on the number of inbound flights from China.</p><p>The updated regulations are to be implemented from midnight on December 30, per Kishida&#39;s announcement.</p><p>The announcement comes as China struggles to keep up with its COVID cases, and mere months after Japan reopened its borders for travel.</p><p>On December 7, China <a href="https://www.insider.com/china-zero-covid-changes-tweaks-policy-2022-12">announced</a> it would be reversing the zero-COVID restrictions that had kept most of the country under multi-year pandemic lockdowns. The reversal came after <a href="https://www.insider.com/china-protests-covid-lockdown-explainer-stakes-2022-11">mass protests</a> swept across every major Chinese city starting in late November.</p><p>However, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-beijing-covid-0ad4ad8851cb1cea47a67abd16024c15">vaccine hesitancy</a> remains pronounced in China, especially among the vulnerable elderly population. The country&#39;s reopening has been followed by a massive spike in COVID cases that has seen <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/the-icu-is-full-medical-staff-frontline-chinas-covid-fight-say-hospitals-are-2022-12-26/">hospitals</a>, morgues, and <a href="https://www.insider.com/beijing-crematorium-covid-surge-police-officers-guarding-amid-2022-12">crematoriums</a> strained beyond capacity. An estimated 250 million COVID infections were recorded in China in December alone, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1fb6044a-3050-44d8-b715-80c18ca5c9ab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to reports citing leaked Chinese health official notes.</a></p><p>Chinese officials previously downplayed the surging cases in the country, making it difficult for experts to determine how many people have died from the virus. In December, China also narrowed its definition of a COVID-related death, limiting the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/china-limits-how-it-defines-covid-deaths-in-official-count.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official death count</a> only to those who have died from pneumonia or respiratory failure.&nbsp;</p><p>On December 25, China announced that it plans to stop publishing daily figures for COVID cases and deaths, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20221225-china-to-stop-publishing-daily-covid-figures-nhc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to AFP,</a> citing the National Health Commission.</p><p>Japan only recently started welcoming back foreign travelers. On October 11, the country <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2022/11/11/japan-travel-open-restrictions-tourism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reopened</a> its borders after nearly three years of pandemic-related restrictions. All travelers need to <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/cp/page22e_000925.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produce</a> vaccination records or negative COVID test results. But, as <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3204657/coronavirus-japan-limit-china-flight-increase-test-travellers-upon-arrival">AFP</a> reported, only travelers displaying symptoms &mdash; and now, anyone traveling in from China &mdash; are required to test upon arrival.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.insider.com/japan-negative-covid-tests-china-travelers-2022-12">Insider</a></div>]]>

			<title>An Arkansas man spent 2 years building a treehouse as a retirement project. He&#39;s listing it for $1.25 million, and it comes with a heated pool and a swinging bridge &amp;mdash; check it out.</title>

			<description>&#34;I thought we would be done in six to eight months, and it took two years,&#34; owner Mike Fitzgerald said of the effort it took to complete the treehouse.</description>

<li>Mike Fitzgerald spent more than two years and at least $600,000 building a treehouse.</li>
<li>The treehouse is supported by four trees, and it&#39;s connected to a patio on another tree via a swinging bridge.</li>
<li>Now, he&#39;s&nbsp;selling the property &mdash; which can be rented on Airbnb &mdash; for $1.25 million.</li>
</ul><div id="slideshow"><div class="slide">Mike Fitzgerald spent his childhood outdoors, climbing trees and making forts. He always dreamed of having his own treehouse, and now that he&#39;s nearing 60, he decided it was time to make it happen.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6397ebe706e8f00019b8a6fd?format=jpeg" height="5862" width="7816" charset="" alt="The exterior of the treehouse."/><figcaption>The exterior of the treehouse, which is supported by four trees.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;We didn&#39;t have the cool, little games on TV that kids play with today,&#34; Fitzgerald told Insider. &#34;We spent time outside, and I always had dreams of being out there and building something.&#34;</p><p>For Fitzgerald, who worked in the tile industry, it was also a retirement project to keep himself busy.</p><p>A local treehouse expert he consulted with, Josh Hart from <a href="https://www.naturalstatetreehouses.com/">Natural State Treehouses,</a> said the trees on his property weren&#39;t strong enough. As they were looking at the trees in the vicinity, they ended up on his neighbor&#39;s property &mdash; which happened to be for sale.</p><p>&#34;I didn&#39;t even think about that property at the time, but I just said, &#39;How about these four trees?&#39;&#34; Fitzgerald said.</p><p>The trees &mdash; which are oak and hickory trees &mdash; turned out to be the perfect type for the design Fitzgerald had in mind, and he decided to buy the land. He paid $30,000 for the lot, <a href="https://www.arcountydata.com/parcel_sponsor.asp?item=C798F7&amp;Page=1&amp;countycode=BENTAX">property records</a> show.</p></div><div class="slide">Fitzgerald wanted the treehouse to be fully elevated by the trees, without any other support. Before he could build anything, he needed an arborist to examine the trees&#39; health.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/638034eb090d4900186e7d81?format=jpeg" height="3000" width="4000" charset="" alt="The treehouse is connected to a lookout patio via a swinging bridge."/><figcaption>The treehouse is connected to a lookout patio via a swinging bridge.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>Every branch, root, and trunk had to be carefully inspected, Fitzgerald said.</p><p>&#34;You&#39;re depending on that tree to last so that your treehouse has the support to stand,&#34; he said.</p><p>Fitzgerald also reached out to <a href="https://nelsontreehouse.com/">the Nelson Treehouse and Supply team</a> &mdash; stars of the Animal Planet &#34;Treehouse Masters&#34; reality TV show &mdash; for advice.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;I had to tell them how high I was going to build it off the ground. I had to measure the trees at the base and up where the treehouse was going to be, and then send all those measurements to them,&#34; Fitzgerald added.</p></div><div class="slide">The treehouse is supported by four trees, and it&#39;s connected&nbsp;to a lookout patio on another tree via a swinging bridge. The bridge, which is almost 30 feet long, was a challenge to complete, Fitzgerald said.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6397f11da3bebb0018b42b4a?format=jpeg" height="4639" width="6186" charset="" alt="The bridge to the lookout patio."/><figcaption>The bridge to the lookout patio is almost 30 feet across.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>The design of the final bridge was inspired by a bridge in a &#34;Treehouse Masters&#34; video, but modified with additional supports, Fitzgerald said.</p><p>&#34;If you go across the bridge, there&#39;s a big hammock that hangs out over the ground on the other end. You can lay out on this big net that just hangs 15 feet up in the air,&#34; he added.</p></div><div class="slide">Fitzgerald completed the bulk of the interior work himself, building the cabinets and bathrooms.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6397ec4206e8f00019b8a715?format=jpeg" height="4648" width="6197" charset="" alt="The interiors of the treehouse."/><figcaption>The interiors of the treehouse.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>The treehouse has a loft-style design. The primary living area is downstairs, and a movable ladder is used to access the sleeping quarters upstairs.</p><p>Most of the wood used in the build was sourced locally and most of the tiles were handmade, Fitzgerald said.&nbsp;</p><p>The treehouse floor was one of the most labor-intensive parts of the build, he added: &#34;I had to cut up literally thousands of reclaimed pieces of wood and put them on the floor.&#34;</p></div><div class="slide">The construction took two years and four months to complete. Fitzgerald started in December 2019 and finished building the property in April 2022.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6397ec6706e8f00019b8a725?format=jpeg" height="4646" width="6195" charset="" alt="The treehouse loft."/><figcaption>The treehouse loft.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;We did the treehouse first because you have to be really careful with the trees when you bring your equipment on,&#34; Fitzgerald said. &#34;You don&#39;t want to run equipment over the root system.&#34;</p><p>It took over a year to build the treehouse and another year to complete the main house, Fitzgerald said.</p><p>&#34;I remembered how hard it was to put the treehouse roof on. It&#39;s up about 30 feet off the ground and everyone was scared to death to get up there, so it took a couple of extra months to get the roof on the treehouse,&#34; he added.</p></div><div class="slide">One of the most striking features of the main house is the outdoor kitchen and dining area, Fitzgerald said.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6397ed8a06e8f00019b8a738?format=jpeg" height="3772" width="5030" charset="" alt="The outdoor kitchen and dining area of the poolhouse."/><figcaption>The outdoor kitchen and dining area of the main house.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;We got a big piece of wood with live edges and made it a really cool outdoor table &mdash; people just love to sit out there. It&#39;s got a grill and an outdoor fireplace as well,&#34; Fitzgerald said.</p></div><div class="slide">Like the treehouse, the main house has two stories. A spiral staircase connects the primary living area to the loft bedroom upstairs.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6397ec7406e8f00019b8a72b?format=jpeg" height="4646" width="6195" charset="" alt="The living area of the primary house."/><figcaption>The living area of the main house.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>Some cabinets in the main house were made from reclaimed truck beds. Fitzgerald also repurposed the wood from an old wagon by turning it into a coffee table.</p></div><div class="slide">Looking back, Fitzgerald says that the treehouse construction process was much more challenging and time-consuming than he expected.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6397ed0ea3bebb0018b42b31?format=jpeg" height="4648" width="6197" charset="" alt="The kitchen in the primary house."/><figcaption>Both the treehouse and the main house have a combined area of 866 square feet, and they each have their own kitchens, bathrooms, and bedrooms.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;I thought we would be done in six to eight months, and it took two years,&#34; Fitzgerald said. &#34;Doing everything so that you could preserve the trees was probably what really slowed everything down.&#34;</p><p>The scale of his treehouse was also new, not just to him but to the local builders and the treehouse expert he consulted with, Fitzgerald added: &#34;I think everybody that worked on the project, it was the first time they had ever done anything like this.&#34;</p></div><div class="slide">Fitzgerald said the treehouse has been attracting attention for years.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6397f0e5a3bebb0018b42b43?format=jpeg" height="3072" width="4096" charset="" alt="One of the bathrooms on the property."/><figcaption>One of the bathrooms on the property.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;From that day we started putting the beams up in the trees, we would have people drive by and just stop to take pictures,&#34; Fitzgerald said.</p><p>Although the property is near a local bike trail, it&#39;s still a quiet area, he said.</p><p>&#34;We had a grand opening and invited most of the people in the neighborhood to come, and they were all just really excited to see it. It&#39;s made me really proud of it,&#34; Fitzgerald added.</p></div><div class="slide">The stones in the driveway and around the pool were sourced from Oklahoma, and transporting them was difficult due to their weight, Fitzgerald said.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6397ec2b06e8f00019b8a70e?format=jpeg" height="2250" width="3000" charset="" alt="The driveway to the property."/><figcaption>The driveway to the property.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;We had to go over there and stack all those stones on a pallet, put them on truck beds, and bring them back,&#34; Fitzgerald said.</p><p>It was about a three to four-hour drive and it required multiple trips to transport them over, he said.</p><p>&#34;I think there&#39;s like 80,000 tons of stone there,&#34; he added.</p></div><div class="slide">Fitzgerald has some advice for anyone looking to build their own treehouse or home: Remember to track all costs because things can get expensive quickly. However, it pays off to invest in good materials.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6399182427c0a700193e04fc?format=jpeg" height="2167" width="2890" charset="" alt="The pool."/><figcaption>The pool.<p class="copyright">Justin Farris</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;When we started off, we had no idea how much it would cost,&#34; Fitzgerald said.</p><p>The project turned out to be expensive because of the process of building the house into the living trees without damaging them, he said.

			<title>4 effective hair-loss treatments we discovered in 2022</title>

			<description>A common blood pressure pill and an arthritis drug are among the new techniques doctors have found successful for regrowing hair or slowing loss.</description>

<li>A hair loss researcher says 2022 was &#34;actually a very big year.&#34;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A whole new class of drugs came to market to treat a common, patchy hair loss condition.</li>
<li>Doctors also discovered the active ingredient in Rogaine can be taken orally, with good results.</li>
</ul><p>Losing your hair can be frustrating because there aren&#39;t a ton of great options for treatment.</p><p>For decades, doctors have essentially relied on two <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/prevent-hair-loss-cure-baldness-2018-3">proven medications</a>: Rogaine, a topical liquid or foam that must be applied to the scalp routinely, or Propecia, an oral tablet and prostate medication that sometimes works to control and prevent male pattern baldness.</p><p>But this year, multiple new options have emerged to treat hair loss in people of every gender, each with promising years of research behind it.</p><p>&#34;I realize I&#39;m biased as somebody who studies hair, but I think 2022 was actually a very big year for lots of things hair-related,&#34; Dr. Arash Mostaghimi, a dermatologist and hair researcher at Harvard and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital, told Insider.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#39;s what&#39;s new:</p><div id="slideshow"><div class="slide">Dermatologists discovered a much cheaper way to use the active ingredient in Rogaine<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63993ac3b08ee10018f4d9b3?format=jpeg" height="1410" width="1880" charset="" alt="white tablets cut in half"/><figcaption>Oral minoxidil is used to treat blood pressure, but a much smaller dose can do wonders for hair loss, dermatologists say.<p class="copyright">MirageC/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>Rogaine is a brand name for the drug minoxidil, which has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3061719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDA-approved</a> as a topical treatment for baldness since 1988.</p><p>But the drug was never originally designed to put on your head. It was actually developed to treat high blood pressure. In 1979, the <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&amp;ApplNo=018154">FDA approved</a> a minoxidil-based drug by Pfizer, called Loniten, to treat blood pressure.</p><p>It was only later discovered how well minoxidil could grow hair. That&#39;s when the topical solution called Rogaine &mdash; from <a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19960513&amp;id=dT5GAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1622,3318023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Upjohn Company</a>, but now owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson &mdash; became available as a foam or lotion.</p><p>This year, more than four decades later, dermatologists are still using minoxidil to treat hair-loss, but differently. It&#39;s now something of an open secret in the field that a tiny dose of<a href="https://www.insider.com/dermatologists-using-blood-pressure-drug-oral-minoxidil-treat-hair-loss-2022-8">&nbsp;<em>oral</em> minoxidil</a> &mdash; the same pill&nbsp;that doctors prescribe at a higher concentration&nbsp;to treat hypertension &mdash; can work just as well as the head rub Rogaine. And&nbsp;it&#39;s dirt cheap, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Like Rogaine, oral minoxidil doesn&#39;t work for everybody who&#39;s balding, but it&#39;s a nice alternative to the sticky topical formulation of the medicine, which can be a hassle to apply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">In 2022, the FDA finally approved a treatment for alopecia areata, the balding condition Jada Pinkett Smith has<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63993b5127c0a700193e06d0?format=jpeg" height="1536" width="2048" charset="" alt="Jada and others with alopecia"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>Alopecia areata is different from hormonal or genetic hair loss.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s an autoimmune condition that triggers inflammation inside your skull, around the root of the hair shaft.</p><p>&#34;Once that inflammation occurs, the hair becomes thinner and falls out, and then it gets stuck in a part of the hair cycle where it doesn&#39;t grow,&#34; Mostaghimi explained.&nbsp;</p><p>This can result in round, smooth bald patches, or even complete hair loss all over the body.</p></div><div class="slide">The new drug is called Olumiant, and it&#39;s a once-a-day pill for adults with severe alopecia areata<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6241dd97a2e45b001950b911?format=jpeg" height="5212" width="6950" charset="" alt="Rep.

Ayanna Pressley has been open about her alopecia areata diagnosis.<p class="copyright">Drew Angerer/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>Mostaghimi said the genetic research to make this new drug possible started in the late 1990s, when a patient advocacy group (The National Alopecia Areata Foundation) partnered with Columbia University to do genetic sequencing on <a href="https://www.insider.com/ayanna-pressley-what-is-alopecia-why-do-people-get-it-2020-1">alopecia areata</a> patients.</p><p>Over the years, they&#39;ve discovered how people with alopecia areata have more mutations in their JAK-STAT pathway, a critical component of the immune system that is also targeted to treat other diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.&nbsp;</p><p>In June, the FDA approved rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant (baricitinib) to treat alopecia areata, after successful late-stage trials. <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nearly-40-adults-alopecia-areata-taking-olumiantr-4-mg-saw-least" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientists found</a>&nbsp;that a four-milligram dose of the drug led to&nbsp;&#34;significant scalp hair regrowth&#34; within a year for 40% of patients. That meant around&nbsp;80% or more scalp coverage.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">2 more alopecia areata treatments reached late-stage trials this year, and could hit the market soon<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/628fe8e314f00200180fe98e?format=jpeg" height="3648" width="5049" charset="" alt="man with alopecia areata"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Alex Papp/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ritlecitinib, a once daily pill from Pfizer, is <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/fda-and-ema-accept-regulatory-submission-pfizers">under FDA review</a>. If approved, it would be available to alopecia areata patients 12 and up.</p><p>Another pharmaceutical maker, Concert, is also trialing a twice daily pill for alopecia areata (CTPâ€‘543). Its results look promising too: some <a href="https://www.insider.com/bald-patients-regrew-hair-using-experimental-drug-in-alopecia-trial-2022-5">patients trialing the drug were able to regrow a near-full head</a> of hair.&nbsp;</p><p>Mostaghimi, whose <a href="https://bwhbulletin.org/2016/06/16/fathers-day-bwh-dad-switches-research-focus-for-daughter/">daughter has alopecia areata</a>, said it would be great to &#34;go from having no FDA-approved options&#34; to treat the condition earlier this year &#34;to, hopefully, up to three, by 2024.&#34;</p></div><div class="slide">This year, we also got the first ever comprehensive study of supplements for hair loss<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63993b9fb08ee10018f4d9ca?format=jpeg" height="1414" width="1885" charset="" alt="Top down view of a womanâ€™s head with thinning hair along the part."/><figcaption>Unlike male pattern hair loss, female pattern hair loss usually presents as a widening part.<p class="copyright">Su Phrrs&#39;a Can Thrta Wang / EyeEm / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>Mostaghimi says he was &#34;inspired by my patients&#34; to research supplements for hair loss.</p><p>He knows his patients are &#34;bombarded by ads for all of these supplements&#34; to regrow hair.</p><p>&#34;I interpret this as, mostly, the fact that we haven&#39;t done our job as the medical field to appropriately develop enough interventions that work,&#34; he added.</p><p>Because supplement brands can sell and market products without undergoing research or FDA approval, &#34;it&#39;s difficult to know what is working and why and how.&#34;&nbsp;</p><p>So the doctor and his colleagues authored a first of its kind <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2798840">systematic review</a> on the safety and effectiveness of supplements for treating hair loss in November.&nbsp;</p><p>The data he collected on supplements, he cautioned, is still &#34;of limited value,&#34; because most of the research done on supplements is conducted in-house, by supplement companies themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Add to that the fact that &#34;any negative studies were just likely never published,&#34; and it&#39;s very hard to tell how well supplements can actually work to grow hair.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">But using supplements for hair loss might just be a waste of money<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63993bd6b08ee10018f4d9d1?format=jpeg" height="1256" width="1675" charset="" alt="Woman looking at bottle of supplements"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Getty Image</p></figcaption></figure><p>The reality is that &#34;for the vast majority of types of hair loss, we have better pharmaceutical interventions&#34; that &#34;provide more consistent and reliable impact&#34; than supplements, Mostaghimi said.</p><p>Drugs like minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia) are typically cheaper than pricey supplements.</p><p>Mostaghimi says he doesn&#39;t bother with supplements to treat his own genetic alopecia.</p><p>&#34;For me, it&#39;s not the right treatment, and I don&#39;t actually encourage my patients to take these medications,&#34; he said.</p><p>But, for patients who are &#34;dead set&#34; on supplements, he does recognize that there are some which &#34;take advantage of pathways that we already target in dermatology with medication.&#34; For example,&nbsp;the plant called saw palmetto, which can be bought as a supplement, targets the 5-alpha reductase pathway, important in the development of male pattern baldness.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies have suggested saw palmetto supplements may help treat some baldness, but finasteride does the job better, and more cheaply, Mostaghimi said.</p></div><div class="slide">What&#39;s next?

This is why many actors choose not to do nudity or simulated sex in any non-union productions.</p></div><div class="slide">Some directors prefer sex scenes to be choreographed in detail.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5bae87300114553aef3f6bd6?format=jpeg" height="643" width="857" charset="" alt="Gone Girl"/><figcaption>Neil Patrick Harris said the sex scene in &#34;Gone Girl&#34; was choreographed.<p class="copyright">20th Century Fox</p></figcaption></figure><p>For any scene, blocking is a typical first step. Directors do a walk-through with actors, discussing when and where they should move during the scene.</p><p>The same is often done during sex scenes. Some directors, like David Fincher (&#34;Gone Girl,&#34; &#34;Fight Club,&#34; &#34;Seven&#34;), will outline specific movements prior to filming.</p><p>For example, Neil Patrick Harris told <a href="https://www.out.com/entertainment/theater-dance/2014/03/11/neil-patrick-harris-metamorphosis-doogie-barney-hedwig">Out magazine in 2014</a> that the sex scene in the film &#34;Gone Girl&#34; was choreographed in a detailed way.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;We had to rehearse the sex scene with David, like every inch of it &mdash; &#39;Then you put your mouth on his d--- here, and then this number of thrusts, and then you ejaculate,&#39;&#34; he told the publication. &#34;It was weird because we&#39;re technically breaking down the sex scene. He wanted it to be almost robotic, that we know exactly where we are, position-wise, where everything goes.&#34;</p></div><div class="slide">But sometimes actors work together to map out the sex scenes.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5f478ecacd2fec00296a47a3?format=jpeg" height="975" width="1300" charset="" alt="5f43cda78d81c3d6f3c78350_Kate Winslet Saoirse Ronan (2)_Ammonite_courtesyNEON"/><figcaption>Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan in &#34;Ammonite.&#34;<p class="copyright">NEON</p></figcaption></figure><p>Some actors prefer to just work out the details of the sex scene they&#39;re filming with their on-screen partner(s).</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/oh-f-ive-forgotten-how-to-act-kate-winslet-back-in-the-awards-race-with-same-sex-romance-ammonite-on-getting-back-to-work" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="20">The Hollywood Reporter in August 2020,</a> Kate Winslet said she choreographed her sex scenes with costar Saoirse Ronan for their film &#34;Ammonite,&#34; directed by Francis Lee (&#34;God&#39;s Own Country&#34;).&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;I just think Saoirse and I, we just felt really safe.

Restricted crew, it&#39;s just available light where we can move 360 degrees with the camera &mdash; this is the intention, and let&#39;s see where it goes from there,&#34; he explained to the publication.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;[In &#34;Wild&#34;] it wasn&#39;t specifically planned for this guy to take Reese [Witherspoon], to turn her on her back, and take her from behind, but it just happened as we were shooting. And [in &#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34;] with Matthew [McConaughey], at one point he had a threesome, with two girls in this trailer home with his friend watching him, and he was on fire,&#34; VallÃ©e explained.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether or not an actor is willing to allow improv during the filming of sex scenes is something that can be negotiated in their SAG-AFTRA nudity rider.</p></div><div class="slide">Actors are usually wearing modesty patches and coverings while filming these scenes.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5bae880a01145540506c3784?format=jpeg" height="776" width="1035" charset="" alt="Master of Sex"/><figcaption>&#34;Masters of Sex&#34; actors use modesty patches.<p class="copyright">SHOWTIME</p></figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever watched characters in the throes of passion and wondered just how naked the actors really are?</p><p>The truth is, when a body part is out of frame or not visible due to how the bodies are positioned, actors are most likely wearing a modesty patch.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s like a big Band-Aid that goes from the front, covering their crotch, and then tucks in the back. It does not look very comfortable!&#34; Michelle Ashford, creator of Showtime&#39;s &#34;Masters of Sex&#34; told <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/sex-scenes-facts">Glamour</a> magazine in 2015.</p><p>As for covering penises? &#34;They wear a sock.

A tube sock over their penis,&#34; Ashford told the magazine.</p><p>Nude-colored underwear, full-body makeup, and other coverings are also used to shield certain body parts from the camera.</p><p>When simulating sex, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/movies/shooting-film-and-tv-sex-scenes-what-really-goes-on.html">props like pillows</a> are placed between actors and prosthetics can be used to create the illusion of sex.</p></div><div class="slide">Sometimes when an actor does not agree to film nude scenes, body doubles and/or CGI are used.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5bae85fb0114553ffc69e302?format=jpeg" height="1608" width="2144" charset="" alt="Cersei Lannister Game of Thrones season seven finale dragonpit"/><figcaption>Lena Headey used a body double on season five of HBO&#39;s &#34;Game of Thrones.&#34;<p class="copyright">HBO</p></figcaption></figure><p>As outlined by SAG-AFTRA, actors decide how much nudity and simulated sex they are willing to do. If production wants to cast an actor who refuses to do nudity for any reason, they often use body doubles.</p><p>And just like leading actors, body doubles have nudity riders in their contracts that explicitly outline the details of their nudity agreement with production.</p><p>Multiple body doubles can even be used to portray one character. Isla Fisher told <a href="https://ew.com/article/2009/02/20/isla-fisher-qa/">Entertainment Weekly in 2009 that</a> multiple doubles were used for her character&#39;s nudity and sex scenes in the film &#34;Wedding Crashers.&#34;</p><p>She said, &#34;I had a hand double for the under-the-table scene. I had a breast double for the boob-in-the-face, and I had a butt double.&#34;</p><p>Things can get a bit more complicated if a scene requires the actor&#39;s face and nude body to be seen at the same time. In these instances, post-production CGI is used to splice together the actor&#39;s face and their double&#39;s nude body.</p><p>This technique was used in the season-five finale of HBO&#39;s &#34;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/game-of-thrones-lena-headey-explains-why-she-used-a-body-double-instead-of-going-naked-a6992296.html">Game of Thrones,&#34;</a> when Lena Headey&#39;s character, Cersei, <a href="https://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/18/game-thrones-lena-headey/">takes her nude walk of atonement</a>. Her stand-in, Rebecca Van Cleave, served as Headey&#39;s nude body double for the scene, according to Entertainment Weekly.</p></div><div class="slide">&#34;Closed sets&#34; are often provided for intimate scenes to help actors feel more comfortable.<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5bae85ce01145512f0086eb4?format=jpeg" height="1384" width="1845" charset="" alt="mad men sex"/><figcaption>A &#34;closed set&#34; means fewer crew members will be around during the scene.<p class="copyright">AMC</p></figcaption></figure><p>Productions often operate on what&#39;s known as a &#34;closed set&#34; during the filming of sex scenes.</p><p>Most film and television sets have hundreds of crew members working while shooting a scene.

Even &#34;closed sets&#34; have half a dozen or more crew members watching. And there are often specific directions actors have to take, so their focus is usually geared toward following the blocking and giving their best performance rather than feeling the heat of the moment.</p><p>That said, VallÃ©e said in his 2015 interview that everyone is human, so occasionally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/movies/shooting-film-and-tv-sex-scenes-what-really-goes-on.html">there can be some real, physical feelings</a>.</p><p>He said, &#34;I&#39;ve never seen an actor with an erection, in all of the films and the sex scenes that I&#39;ve done, but it doesn&#39;t mean that I haven&#39;t seen a guy being excited.

<li>&#34;A Christmas Story&#34; actor Zack Ward told Insider that he was separated from his peers while filming.</li>
<li>Ward played neighborhood bully Scut Farkus in the 1983 holiday classic.&nbsp;</li>
<li>According to Ward, he was isolated to create tension among the child actors.</li>
</ul><p>The actor who <a href="https://www.insider.com/a-christmas-story-cast-then-and-now">played bully Scut Farkus</a> in the 1983 film &#34;A Christmas Story&#34; revealed in a recent interview with Insider that he and costar Yano Anaya were kept separate from the other child actors while filming.</p><p>According to Ward, this was by design, as director Bob Clark wanted to create a sense of tension between Ward and Anaya (who played bullies Scut and Grover Gill, respectively) and the rest of the kids, including Peter Billingsley and Ian Petrella, who played Scut and Grover&#39;s frequent victims Ralphie and Randy Parker.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Most of the time Yano and I were not hanging out with the other kids. They had different shooting schedules than we did,&#34; Ward told Insider. &#34;[Clark] told our parents, &#39;I just want Yano and Zack to hang out and be friends, and if possible, without being rude to the other kids, don&#39;t really hang out with the other kids that much.&#39;&#34;</p><p>Per Ward, Clark wanted the other child actors to have &#34;an innate nervousness when these two kids &mdash; the two bullies &mdash; show up on set like they&#39;re not quite sure what&#39;s gonna happen.&#34; The actor told Insider that he thinks the film succeeded in part because of this tension between the younger cast members.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/63a486ad2345c00019eaa06b?format=jpeg" height="900" width="1200" charset="" alt="Flick, Randy, Ralphie, and Schwartz face off against Grover Gill and Scut Farkus in this still from &#34;A Christmas Story.&#34;"/><figcaption>Flick, Randy, Ralphie, and Schwartz face off against Grover Gill and Scut Farkus in this still from &#34;A Christmas Story.&#34;<p class="copyright">MGM</p></figcaption></figure><p>But despite their separation, Ward said he and the rest of the children in the cast got along well.</p><p>&#34;We liked each other. And then as we grew up, we just always had this touchstone that we could relate to, and then we got to build that touchstone into another movie,&#34; Ward said, referring to the recent sequel to &#34;A Christmas Story.&#34;&nbsp;</p><p>Titled &#34;A Christmas Story Christmas,&#34; the new film was released on HBO Max in November, and follows a now-adult Ralphie (Peter Billingsley, reprising his role from the original) as he travels home to Indiana with his family after the death of his father, &#34;The Old Man.&#34;&nbsp;</p><p>Ward, Anaya, Petrella, Scott Schwartz, and R.D.

Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Netflix</p></figcaption></figure><ul class="summary-list">
<li>The stars of &#34;Bad Vegan&#34; and &#34;The Tinder Swindler&#34; feel they were misrepresented by Netflix.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Cecilie FjellhÃ¸y said her Tinder fraudster was a &#34;dangerous man&#34; but wasn&#39;t presented that way.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sarma Melngailis of &#34;Bad Vegan&#34; said Netflix &#34;made a mockery&#34; of her abuse.</li>
</ul><p><br/>&#34;&#39;Bad Vegan: Fame: Fraud: Fugitives&#34; and &#34;The Tinder Swindler&#34; were huge hits for Netflix in 2022. But for the women whose experiences at the hands of manipulative men were revealed to millions in the compelling scammer documentaries, the exposure has been a mixed blessing &mdash; a source of regret but also a cause for hope.</p><p>Cecilie FjellhÃ¸y was the victim of a high-profile romantic scam by Simon Leviev (whose real name is Shimon Hayut), <a href="https://www.insider.com/tinder-swindler-accused-spending-2-million-private-jets-leviev-family-2022-3">the so-called Tinder Swindler. </a></p><p><a href="https://www.insider.com/tinder-swindler-accused-spending-2-million-private-jets-leviev-family-2022-3">Leviev is</a> a &#34;dangerous man,&#34; whom she fell in love with and lost all her money to after months of financial and emotional abuse, FjellhÃ¸y said.</p><p>Once she realized what was happening &mdash; <a href="https://www.insider.com/tinder-swindler-fake-billionaire-scammed-women-dates-into-debt-documentary-2022-2">that her lover was behind a Ponzi scheme designed to scam women out of tens of thousands of dollars</a> &mdash; she went to the police, who just laughed at her, she told Insider.&nbsp;</p><p>She turned to the media in her home country of Norway, and her story went viral. Raw Films, an award-winning production company in London, picked it up and turned it into the hit docuseries &#34;The Tinder Swindler,&#34; distributed by Netflix.</p><h2>&#39;It&#39;s just another telling of how stupidly in love we were&#39;</h2><p>FjellhÃ¸y wanted a factual documentary, she told Insider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;I wanted to know why it is so difficult to catch this guy. To know why the police aren&#39;t doing enough, why it was so simple for him to commit this fraud? Those were the big questions I wanted the film to answer.&#34;</p><p>&#34;So when we were told it was not going to be that, I was really disappointed. It&#39;s just another telling of how stupidly in love we were,&#34; she said.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Even calling it the &#39;Tinder Swindler,&#39; it just was branded from the start,&#34; she said. &#34;It just made it seem not as serious.&#34;</p><p>Netflix focused on the ways the women fell for the fraud rather than the cruel crimes committed by Leviev, FjellhÃ¸y said.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/62e2562c536a23001911fd7d?format=jpeg" height="1090" width="1453" charset="" alt="A screenshot of a phone contact for Simon Leviev from the documentary."/><figcaption>The Tinder Swindler was released on February 2, 2022.<p class="copyright">Netflix</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;A lot of people don&#39;t even understand that it&#39;s a documentary,&#34; FjellhÃ¸y told Insider. &#34;We have people come up to us as though we&#39;re actresses and asking if we&#39;re real. Sometimes documentaries can be too well-made. People aren&#39;t even looking at you as a real person.</p><p>&#34;And this is hard when you&#39;re airing your most personal stories. You have to show how you went from being very much in love, you know, to have to talk about how you almost killed yourself.&#34;</p><p>FjellhÃ¸y said she cried the first time she saw it. &#34;I just felt stupid because I was the one picked to be the symbol of love,&#34; she said. &#34;I had to be honest about how many matches I had on Tinder, how long I&#39;d been on there, and how I viewed love. I had to say that I slept with him on the first date. I had to say stuff that I didn&#39;t want to say. So you&#39;re being used.&#34;</p><p>In describing the negative feedback she got after the show aired, she said that a man approached her in Los Angeles to tell her she was &#34;so embarrassing,&#34; instead of the victim of a complex crime.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked if Netflix portrayed the abuse correctly, FjellhÃ¸y said, &#34;No, that&#39;s why I wanted it to be more investigative and maybe have a psychologist. Someone to explain what the abuse actually was.&#34;</p><h2><strong>Breaking bad vegan</strong></h2><p>Another documentary star, <a href="mailto:dragonfly8q@gmail.com">Sarma Melngailis</a> of &#34;Bad Vegan,&#34; also criticized Netflix for its portrayal of her.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/62e25782536a23001911fdad?format=jpeg" height="1987" width="2649" charset="" alt="Sarma Melngailis, co-author during &#34;RAW FOOD/real world&#34; Book Launch Celebration at Pure Food and Wine in New York City, New York, United States."/><figcaption>Sarma Melngailis, co-author during &#34;RAW FOOD/real world&#34; Book Launch Celebration at Pure Food and Wine in New York City, New York, United States.<p class="copyright">Theo Wargo/WireImage</p></figcaption></figure><p>Melngailis put raw vegan food on the map. Her New York restaurant, Pure Food and Wine, opened in 2004 and helped plant-based eating move away from a minority niche to being favored by the rich and famous.&nbsp;</p><p>Celebrities flocked to her restaurant to sample such dishes as mango and Thai basil salad, which a <a href="https://nymag.com/nymetro/food/reviews/restaurant/9670/">New York Magazine review</a> described as offering &#34;as much exotic sunniness as one bowl can contain.&#34;&nbsp;</p><p>Her business venture was a success, and Melngailis was feted. And then she met her abuser.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix documented the rise and public fall of Melngailis in &#34;Bad Vegan,&#34; directed by Chris Smith of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fyre-festival-expectations-vs-reality-2017-4">&#34;Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened&#34;</a> fame.</p><p><a href="https://ny.eater.com/2015/1/13/7539521/pure-food-wine-is-dark-tonight-as-staff-walks-out-over-unpaid-wages">Melngailis&#39; businesses collapsed in 2015 after her unpaid staff walked out,</a> and she was nowhere to be found.&nbsp;</p><p>There was confusion and anger from her employees, friends, and associates &mdash; how did this woman crash everything she&#39;d worked so hard to build?</p><p>Behind closed doors, she was being sexually, mentally, and financially abused, Melngailis told Insider.</p><p>Her partner, Anthony Strangis, was <a href="https://www.insider.com/bad-vegan-women-who-were-gaslighted-committing-unethical-acts-2022-4">manipulating her into eventually stealing $2 million from her investors and employees.&nbsp;</a></p><p>The pair went missing and were found ordering pizza in a hotel room in Tennessee in 2016. In 2017, Melngailis took a plea deal and pleaded guilty to criminal tax fraud, grand larceny, and premeditated fraud, and served four months at Rikers Island in the summer of 2017.</p><p>She spent four months in prison, and Strangis spent nearly a year behind bars.&nbsp;</p><h2>Melngailis felt Netflix was mocking her</h2><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/62ee3571a69cad0019622f33?format=jpeg" height="2674" width="3565" charset="" alt="Sarma Melngailis and her dog Leon"/><figcaption>Sarma Melngailis and her dog Leon<p class="copyright">Sarma Melngailis</p></figcaption></figure><p>Netflix &#34;made a joke&#34; of the trauma she endured at the hands of Strangis, Melngailis said. &#34;Bad Vegan&#34; included many inaccuracies, she claimed, and did a &#34;great disservice to all the people that have been through something like this.&#34;</p><p>The most mind-blowing part of Melngailis&#39; abuse may be the immortal-dog storyline: Strangis was able to convince the successful restaurant entrepreneur that her beloved Staffy, Leon, could become immortal.&nbsp;</p><p>For people who haven&#39;t experienced abusive control, this might sound inconceivable, but the docudrama establishes that it was part of the way Strangis managed to control Melgnalis and convince her that he had superhuman powers that she, too, could access if she just did what he said.</p><p>One day, as Melngailis was scrolling through Twitter, she came across a post from a spoof account called Perpetual Pup, run by Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;You wanted to make your dog immortal. You&#39;re not alone,&#34; read the tweet, which had a video attached called &#34;Not All Dogs Have to Go to Heaven.&#34;&nbsp;</p><p>Confused, Melngailis watched the video of dogs chasing Frisbees, while a narrator said you can &#34;say goodbye to saying goodbye.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Side effects may include confusion, sudden changes in behavior, and/or loss of money. Excessive wire transfers may occur. If you have a history of questionable romantic relationships, Perpetual may be right for you,&#34; the ad riffed, before cutting to a picture of Melgnailis&#39; face, revealing itself as an ad for &#34;Bad Vegan.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I would genuinely be curious, just as a study of human nature, to ask all those people to explain what they were thinking,&#34; said Melngailis. &#34;Because you know what, would they have made a promo like that for a documentary about Harvey Weinstein?</p><p>&#34;I&#39;ve been physically, emotionally, and sexually abused &mdash; and they made a mockery of the whole thing. They were basically mocking psychological abuse.&#34;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/62ee35dd8677d80018ee3ce6?format=jpeg" height="1882" width="2510" charset="" alt="Sarma Melngailis&#39; dog Leon"/><figcaption>Sarma Melngailis&#39; dog Leon<p class="copyright">Sarma Melngailis</p></figcaption></figure><p>Melngailis said that even she doesn&#39;t fully understand how Strangis did what he did. &#34;It&#39;s not so much that he had me fully convinced of these things, it&#39;s more that he was able to get my consciousness to grab on to these concepts as possibilities, and the more I imagined them, the more detached from reality I got.&#34;</p><p>&#34;What I do know,&#34; she continued, &#34;is that this kind of manipulation &mdash; abuse, really &mdash; is so much more common than we think, and so for Netflix to have made that campaign was a kick in the face to a lot of people who have endured such abuse. It was reinforcing the idea that he couldn&#39;t be legitimate, that <em>we&nbsp;</em>are the crazy ones.&#34;</p><p>Netflix has not responded to Insider&#39;s request for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously asked by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/22/bad-vegan-netflix-tv-show-inside-bizarre-world">The Guardian</a> if the show was fair to Melngailis, director Chris Smith said&nbsp; &#34;Look, everything is shades of grey.&#34;</p><p>&#34;We tried to represent it as accurately as we could from the information we had through the documentation that was presented to us and through the interview.&#34;</p><h2><strong>The profits go to Netflix&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Romantic scams, and scammer documentaries in general, have proven incredibly lucrative for Netlflix.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Bad Vegan&#34; and &#34;The Tinder Swindler&#34; were both in the top-10 most-viewed shows the week they aired, <a href="https://top10.netflix.com/tv?week=2022-04-03">according to Netflix data.</a></p><p>But the stars said that having their story platformed doesn&#39;t fix their financial losses. The payment for the rights to their stories didn&#39;t cover their debts, they said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Melngailis said that it wasn&#39;t worth it for all the backlash and abuse she faced after the documentary aired &mdash; which she blames on the show&#39;s framing. &#34;They made my life more difficult and put me through more shit,&#34; she said.</p><p>FjellhÃ¸y told Insider that after being a part of a popular and influential Netflix documentary, &#34;everyone is thinking that we&#39;re millionaires now,&#34; she said.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/62ee3605a69cad0019622f3d?format=jpeg" height="599" width="800" charset="" alt="Cecilie FjellhÃ¸y talks about falling in love with a man on Tinder who turned out to be a seasoned con artist."/><figcaption>In &#34;The Tinder Swindler,Cecilie FjellhÃ¸y talks about falling in love with a man on Tinder who turned out to be a seasoned con artist.<p class="copyright">Courtesy of Netflix</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;The people at the bottom that get the least give it all. I don&#39;t see anything of this success. We&#39;re still struggling with debt, and we&#39;re in courts and everything. But it was amazing for Netflix,&#34; FjellhÃ¸y said.</p><p>Netflix did not reply to Insider&#39;s requests for comment on FjellhÃ¸y and Melngailis&#39; complaints.</p><p>In response to Melngailis&#39; criticism of &#34;Bad Vegan,&#34; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/22/bad-vegan-netflix-tv-show-inside-bizarre-world">director Chris Smith told The Guardian</a>: &#34;Look, everything is shades of gray. We tried to represent it as accurately as we could from the information we had through the documentation that was presented to us and through the interview.&#34;</p><h2><strong>From scam victims to heroines</strong></h2><p>In terms of impact on the lives of scam victims everywhere, Melngailis, FjellhÃ¸y, and Ayleen Charlotte, another one of Simon Leviev&#39;s victims, told Insider they were grateful for the opportunity to help people.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the hardships that have come from both the scam itself and the aftermath of the documentary, FjellhÃ¸y said it was &#34;worth it&#34; for the love she has also received.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;I&#39;ve gotten so many messages saying I&#39;m inspiring and I&#39;m brave, and they really admire the courage that&#39;s taken, which has made it much more worth it,&#34; she said, adding that people tell her she&#39;d helped them overcome their embarrassment over being the victim of a scam.&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte &mdash; the &#34;bad bitch&#34; victim of&nbsp; &#34;The Tinder Swindler,&#34; as she put it &mdash; had a positive experience with the documentary, she told Insider.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;I wanted to put his face out there because nothing had been done with my case. Second, I want to help people. And that&#39;s what I did. I mean, I got so many amazing messages from all over the world, and that I gave a lot of people a lot of courage for doing what I did, as well,&#34; Charlotte told Insider.</p><p>Melngailis, while remaining critical of Netflix, agreed that &#34;one of the things that I&#39;ve heard over and over again &mdash; it is&nbsp; usually women but occasionally men &mdash; but people who have been manipulated in some kind of similar way feel less alone.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I&#39;ve also heard from loads of people telling me that watching it has inspired them to try going or shifting towards vegan. So that&#39;s nice, at least! A few animals saved, perhaps,&#34; she said, ending our email communication with a winking emoji.&nbsp;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.insider.com/tinder-swindler-bad-vegan-stars-netflix-failed-abuse-victims-2022-8">Insider</a></div>]]>
