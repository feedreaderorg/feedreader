			<title>Vanishing North Atlantic right whale to remain protected under Endangered Species Act</title>
			<description>The vanishing North Atlantic right whale will remain protected under the Endangered Species Act. The species will require a series of protective steps to ensure they don't go extinct.</description>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fading North Atlantic right whale will remain protected under the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/endangered-species" target="_blank"&gt;Endangered Species Act&lt;/a&gt;, and the species requires a series of protective steps to stave off extinction, federal authorities said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The whales number only about 340 and they have declined in population in recent years. &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/noaa-deploys-new-hurricane-technology-improve-forecasting" target="_blank"&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; released a review of the whale's status on Tuesday that said the whale "is continuing to decline and has not met many of the recovery criteria outlined" in its recovery plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Protection of the whale is a source of dispute between conservationists and commercial fishermen because one of the top threats to the animals is entanglement in fishing gear. NOAA performed a required five-year review of the whale's status that said the animal is continuing to decline because of the threats of fishing gear, collisions with ships and other stressors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There is also uncertainty regarding the effect of long-term sublethal entanglements, emerging environmental stressors including climate change, and the compounding effects of multiple continuous stressors that may be limiting North Atlantic right whale calving and recovery," the agency said in its report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/toned-down-paul-lepage-says-maine-crumbling-around-democratic-successor-gov-jane-mills" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A TONED DOWN PAUL LEPAGE SAYS 'MAINE IS CRUMBLING’ AROUND HIS DEMOCRATIC SUCCESSOR GOV. JANE MILLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NOAA also released recommended actions to try to stabilize the whale's population. The actions include partnering with the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/canada" target="_blank"&gt;Canadian government&lt;/a&gt; to reduce collisions and entanglements. The whales migrate every year from the waters off Georgia and Florida to New England and Canada.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agency also recommended more research and implementation of fishing gear modifications that reduce risk to the whales. It also said there should be more emphasis placed on the removal of derelict fishing gear from the whales' range.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NOAA's announcement came a week after Maine's congressional delegation announced plans to use the federal spending bill to attempt to delay new protections for the whales for six years. That would put a halt to new restrictions on lobster fishing, an industry based largely in Maine. The delegation and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maine-governor-democrat-janet-mills-remain-office-beating-gop-challenger-paul-lepage" target="_blank"&gt;Democratic Gov. Janet Mills&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement that the planned restrictions would "not meaningfully protect the right whale, but will threaten the livelihoods of thousands of Maine families and small businesses."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Environmental groups that have called for more whale protections said the delay would hasten the extinction of the species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The science is clear: humans are killing right whales faster than they can reproduce, and entanglement in lobster gear is a leading cause," said Erica Fuller, an attorney with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/major-eco-group-saw-large-funding-uptick-fueled-liberal-dark-money-network-best-year-ever" target="_blank"&gt;Conservation Law Foundation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

			<title>Christmas miracle: Mom who thought son dead finds him 12 years later in France</title>
			<description>Joyce Curtis last saw her son in 2010 when he turned up in a French hospital, and now 12 years later she found him after he was once again admitted to a French hospital.</description>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Scottish woman is celebrating a Christmas miracle after learning her son, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons" target="_blank"&gt;whom she believed was dead&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade, is still alive and may soon return home. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I can’t believe it," Joyce Curtis, who lives in Glasgow, told The Herald newspaper. "&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" target="_blank"&gt;I thought with COVID&lt;/a&gt; and everything that has gone on, I thought he was dead. I grieved for him."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When I got the call to say he was alive I just went into shock," she continued, saying she cried all day after learning the news. "Then, of course, I phoned my mother and I phoned my brother and I phoned my daughter to tell them."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Everyone is asking after him now. Nikky is a good boy. The feeling is that I still can’t believe it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/ken-deland-american-college-students-disappearance-europe-blur-family-says" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEN DELAND: AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT'S DISAPPEARANCE IN EUROPE ‘STILL A BLUR,' FAMILY SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curtis filed a missing person report in 2009 after not hearing from her son, Nicholas, for some time: He had traveled to Europe to find work, and she had last heard that he was hitchhiking across Spain and France. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The British Consulate in Paris contacted the Curtis family in 2010 to inform them that their son was in a hospital. The couple flew over to France to visit him – the last time they would see him until 2022. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-reported-missing-virginias-shenandoah-national-park-2-months-backcountry-trip" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAN REPORTED MISSING IN VIRGINIA'S SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK MORE THAN 2 MONTHS AFTER BACKCOUNTRY TRIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curtis believed it was clear that her son had spent time "living rough" on the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france" target="_blank"&gt;streets of Paris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that, Nicholas just "disappeared again," even though the consulate said it would put him on a flight back to the U.K. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-month-old-found-safe-being-kidnapped-three-days-ago" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHIO 5-MONTH-OLD FOUND SAFE AFTER BEING KIDNAPPED THREE DAYS AGO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I was expecting him home at Glasgow at a certain time," Curtis explained. "I worked at the Southern General Hospital at the time. I was waiting on him coming home and there was no sign."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curtis said she called every airport to see if her son had gotten on a flight, but got no confirmation and heard nothing further for over 10 years – until the week of Christmas 2022. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curtis lost her husband back in June of this year and resigned herself to the idea that her son was gone, too, when she received a call from the British Consulate in Paris to learn that her son had been hospitalized again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It's like that film 'Miracle on 34th Street.' It's like a miracle," she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has started to make arrangements for his return, but she does not want to build her hopes up until he is back in Scotland. She even hopes to visit Paris, so she might see him once again before his return.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

			<title>North Carolina crash during police pursuit kills 1, injures 1</title>
			<description>A car crash during a police pursuit in North Carolina killed one person and injured another. The chase involved a car linked to an armed robbery on Tuesday.</description>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One person was killed and another was injured in a crash during a police pursuit involving a vehicle linked to an armed robbery on Tuesday, police in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina" target="_blank"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A license plate reader alerted &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank"&gt;Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police officers&lt;/a&gt; to the vehicle associated with an armed robbery and officers tried to stop it, police tweeted. The driver refused to pull over and officers pursued the vehicle since it was associated with a crime dangerous to life, police said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/north-carolina-authorities-say-two-dead-tv-news-chopper-crashes-charlotte-report" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORTH CAROLINA AUTHORITIES SAY TWO DEAD AFTER TV NEWS CHOPPER CRASHES IN CHARLOTTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deputy Chief Jacquelyn Hulsey said the pursuit lasted 10 to 12 minutes, news outlets reported. The vehicle struck a deflation device police put down on West Boulevard and continued for a time until it crashed into a tree, she said. The driver died at the scene and the passenger, who was not seriously hurt, was taken to a hospital for treatment, Hulsey said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The department’s &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/investigations" target="_blank"&gt;major crash unit is investigating the crash&lt;/a&gt;, the armed robbery unit is investigating the crime that led to the pursuit and internal affairs is investigating to make sure officers followed policy, Hulsey said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

			<title>Homeless man dies from the cold while traveling to see family members on Christmas day</title>
			<description>A homeless man died from cold weather exposure on Christmas day. The man was trying to travel from Louisiana to Tennessee to get to his family. He was living in the woods when he died.</description>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A 57-year-old homeless man, who died from &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/frostbite-temperatures-signs-symptoms-prevent" target="_blank"&gt;cold weather exposure&lt;/a&gt; Christmas day, was trying to travel from Louisiana to Tennessee to get to family members, officials said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Charles Wilson Ligon Jr. was found dead by hunters in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/mississippi" target="_blank"&gt;southern Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; Monday. Ligon was dressed in a light jacket and had money and a cellphone, The Times-Picayune reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We were able to notify next of kin, and it was evident that the family was trying to work with him to get him back to Tennessee. But he didn’t have the means of getting a bus ticket or getting money wired to him," Pearl River County Coroner Derek Turnage told the Sun Herald of Biloxi. "He didn’t have a current ID, which was the reason why he could not get those things done. The family was struggling to get him there."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/memorial-service-held-los-angeles-homeless-people-died-street" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEMORIAL SERVICE HELD FOR LOS ANGELES HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO DIED ON THE STREETS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ligon left Slidell, Louisiana, in mid-December without a vehicle and was living in the woods during the time of his death, Turnage said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blinding &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/bomb-cyclone-impact-holiday-travel-blizzards-cold-temps-across-nation" target="_blank"&gt;blizzards, freezing rain&lt;/a&gt; and frigid cold that stretched from Maine to Seattle over the holiday weekend is blamed for at least 49 deaths across the country. The National Weather Service says about 60% of the U.S. population faced some sort of winter weather advisory or warning during the widespread Arctic Blast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, in the Deep South cold weather has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/water" target="_blank"&gt;upended water systems&lt;/a&gt; after days of freezing temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

			<title>Suspected California serial killer charged with seventh murder</title>
			<description>Suspected serial killer Wesley Brownlee was linked to a seventh murder and is facing five additional charges in California after a rash of random attacks.</description>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A suspected California serial killer, who Stockton police previously said was on a "mission to kill," was linked to a seventh murder and faces five additional charges. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-serial-killer-police-arrest-man-suspected-stockton-murders" target="_blank"&gt;Wesley Brownlee&lt;/a&gt;, 43, is now accused of killing seven men and wounding a homeless woman in a rash of random attacks in California going back to April 2021. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brownlee's seventh victim was identified as Mervin Harmon in the amended criminal complaint that prosecutors filed in San Joaquin County Court on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harmon was allegedly shot by Brownlee in Alameda County on April 16, 2021, according to the complaint. He's scheduled to return to court on Jan. 3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/stockton-serial-killer-how-california-police-tracked-down-shadowy-murder-suspect" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STOCKTON SERIAL KILLER: HOW CALIFORNIA POLICE TRACKED DOWN SHADOWY MURDER SUSPECT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tuesday's court filing also includes &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide" target="_blank"&gt;three more murder charges&lt;/a&gt; and an attempted murder charge for the deaths of Paul Yaw, Salvador Debudey Jr. and Juan Alexander Vasquez, as well as the attack on the lone survivor, Natasha LaTour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The murder charge for Harmon's killing is new, but Brownlee was suspected of the other attacks but never formally charged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The San Joaquin County District Attorney’s Office continues to collaborate with our local law enforcement agencies to ensure justice for these victims," District Attorney Tori Verber Salazar said in a statement. "We would like to thank the community for their support and law enforcement for their diligent investigation and apprehension of the suspect."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brownlee allegedly ambushed his victims in parks and on sidewalks under the cloak of night, with no publicly known motive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/stockton-serial-killings-california-person-interest-spotted-near-multiple-crime-scenes-police-say" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STOCKTON SERIAL KILLINGS: CALIFORNIA ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ SPOTTED NEAR MULTIPLE MURDER SCENES, POLICE SAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of the shootings took place in Stockton, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;happened in Oakland, California&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on April 10, 2021. Police said they believe all the shootings were related, based on ballistic evidence and surveillance video.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/stockton-california-serial-killer-survivor-reported-attack" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lone survivor, LaTour&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told police that her attacker didn’t say anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There were no words exchanged," she recalled in an interview with San Joaquin County’s independent &lt;a href="https://209times.com/stockton/exclusive-woman-who-survived-stockton-serial-killer-speaks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;u&gt;local news outlet, 209 Times&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Didn't come any closer. Didn't say anything. Just started shooting. I saw, I saw flashes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/most-shocking-grisly-murders-2022" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE MOST SHOCKING AND GRISLY MURDERS OF 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;LaTour, Serrano and Harmon were allegedly attacked by Brownlee in about a week span in April 2021 but &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the accused gunman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; went dormant until this summer, according to investigators. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between July and September, five men were fatally shot, according to police. Each of them was alone in a "very dark" area at the time of ambush, police previously told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tips poured in, and investigators soon zeroed in on Brownlee as a person of interest and watched him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Our surveillance team followed this person while he was driving," &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank"&gt;Stockton Police Chief&lt;/a&gt; Stanley McFadden said after Brownlee's arrest in October. "We watched his patterns, and determined early [Oct. 15], he was on a mission to kill."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' Michael Ruiz contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

			<title>Michelle Obama says she 'couldn't stand' Barack for 10 years</title>
			<description>Former first lady Michelle Obama said she "couldn't stand" her husband, Barack, when their children were at a young stage.</description>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former first lady Michelle Obama said she "couldn't stand" her husband, former President Obama, when their children were young.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"People think I'm being catty for saying this: it's like, there were 10 years where I couldn't stand my husband," the former first lady said in an interview earlier this month with Revolt. "And guess when it happened? When those kids were little."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-told-obama-dems-lost-house-2010-because-white-men-get-mood-they-dont-have-jobs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PELOSI TOLD OBAMA DEMS LOST HOUSE IN 2010 BECAUSE WHITE MEN 'GET IN A MOOD' WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE JOBS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-told-obama-dems-lost-house-2010-because-white-men-get-mood-they-dont-have-jobs" target="_blank"&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt; daughters, Malia and Sasha, were ages 7 and 10 when they moved to the White House. Their mother said in the interview to promote her new book that the young children posed a challenge as she and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/obama-admits-globalization-disrupted-traditional-societies-says-politicians-need-better-way-sell-it" target="_blank"&gt;the former president&lt;/a&gt; advanced their careers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"For 10 years while we’re trying to build our careers and worrying about school and who’s doing what and what, I was like, ‘Argh, this isn’t even!’" Obama said. "And guess what? Marriage isn’t 50/50, ever. Ever. There are times I’m 70, he’s 30. There are times he’s 60, 40. But guess what? Ten years. We’ve been married 30. I would take 10 bad years over 30 — it’s just how you look at it. People give up — ‘Five years; I can’t take it.’"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/obama-admits-globalization-disrupted-traditional-societies-says-politicians-need-better-way-sell-it" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBAMA ADMITS ‘GLOBALIZATION’ DISRUPTED ‘TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES’, SAYS POLITICIANS NEED A BETTER WAY TO SELL IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/michelle-obama-claims-criticized-feminists-prioritizing-motherhood-white-house" target="_blank"&gt;Obamas&lt;/a&gt; met at a law firm in Chicago in 1989. Their net worth is now at least $70 million. Their joint deal in 2017 for their memoirs was estimated to be worth $65 million. The couple later cut a deal with Netflix that is estimated to be around $50 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/michelle-obama-claims-criticized-feminists-prioritizing-motherhood-white-house" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICHELLE OBAMA CLAIMS SHE WAS 'CRITICIZED BY FEMINISTS’ FOR PRIORITIZING MOTHERHOOD IN WHITE HOUSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michelle said in the December interview that she always respected her husband through their challenges. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Do you like him? I mean, you could be mad at him, but do you still look at him and go, 'I'm not happy with you, but I respect you. I don't agree with you, but you're still a kind, smart person,'" she said of relationship troubles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET FOX NATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michelle's second book "The Light We Carry," was published in November. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

			<title>COVID in Beijing 'peaks' as hospitals, funeral homes fill up</title>
			<description>Chinese officials Wednesday claimed that COVID cases in Beijing have 'peaked' following the reversal of strict policies, but hospitals and funeral homes are struggling to keep up.</description>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china" target="_blank"&gt;Coronavirus cases in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; have allegedly peaked as the city comes back to life after China lifted its strict COVID-policies earlier this month, though hospitals and funeral homes are telling a different story reports said Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Beijing is the first city to have gone through the infection peak, where life and work are coming back to normal as we speak," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Webin told reporters Wednesday. "Relevant Chinese departments have made scientific assessments of the potential peaks in other provinces and cities."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China reported three new COVID-related deaths Tuesday, a slight increase from the one death reported Monday. However, reports have long suggested that the Chinese government has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-ramps-cremations-covid-19-cases-rise" target="_blank"&gt;underreported its case and mortality count&lt;/a&gt; since cases first broke out three years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-remove-covid-19-quarantine-regulations-inbound-travelers" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINA TO REMOVE COVID-19 QUARANTINE REGULATIONS FOR INBOUND TRAVELERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In its latest daily update – last posted on Saturday – China’s National Health Commission said that a total of 5,237 people have died from the virus over the last three years – a figure believed to be grossly underreported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. in contrast has reported over 1 million deaths from the virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Facts are that since COVID began three years ago, the Chinese government has always put the people and their lives above all else," the ministry’s spokesman claimed Wednesday. "Globally speaking, China has had the lowest rates of severe cases and mortality."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China has not only faced international condemnation for its severe COVID policies like forced quarantine in state facilities and massive community lockdowns – which also led to rare nationwide protests – but reports from hospitals, crematoriums and funeral homes suggest they &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-rushes-bolster-healthcare-amid-covid-spike-overwhelming-hospitals" target="_blank"&gt;are struggling under large COVID cases loads.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Reuters report Wednesday found that the recent reversal of strict COVID policies has meant the virus has spread unchecked, leaving its health system overwhelmed as millions are believed to have been infected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-grapples-massive-covid-wave-full-emergency-wards-crowded-crematoriums-many-people-dying" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINA GRAPPLES MASSIVE COVID WAVE WITH FULL EMERGENCY WARDS AND CROWDED CREMATORIUMS: 'MANY PEOPLE DYING'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I’ve been doing this job for 30 years and this is the busiest I have ever known it," one ambulance driver told the publication. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One worker out of Hauxi Hospital in the city of Chengdu reported being "extremely busy" as long lines queued up outside and inside the emergency room Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another staff member from the emergency department told Reuters that "almost all" the incoming patients were COVID positive, and the hospital had run out of medications to help treat the virus and were instead forced to just help alleviate the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A funeral home in Chengdu said it was holding 30 to 50 processions a day as smoke constantly billowed from its crematorium. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There have been so many deaths from COVID lately," one worker told the publication. "Cremation slots are all fully booked. You can’t get one until the new year."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wang on Wednesday dismissed reports that China’s COVID policies have failed and claimed, "Western media have deliberately hyped up and even misrepresented China’s COVID policy adjustment."&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

			<title>In Alabama, Autauga County sheriff dies after short battle with cancer</title>
			<description>The Autauga County sheriff died on Monday after briefly battling cancer. He was weeks from starting his third term as sheriff. The governor will choose someone to take his place.</description>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The sheriff in &lt;a href="https://www.wbrc.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Autauga County&lt;/a&gt; died Monday just weeks before he was set to start his third term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sheriff Joe Sedinger died after a brief illness, according to the sheriff's office. A statement of condolence from Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said the sheriff had a brief battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sedinger started working at the Autauga County Sheriff's Office nearly three decades ago, climbing the ranks until he was first elected sheriff eight years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sedinger started as a road deputy on patrol and ended up working in every division except narcotics. He also was a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/veterans" target="_blank"&gt;veteran of the U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt;, the Alabama National Guard and the Navy Reserves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/new-years-eve-charity-sponsors-bucket-list-trip-nyc-veterans-military-families" target="_blank"&gt;FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE, CHARITY SPONSORS 'BUCKET LIST' TRIP TO NYC FOR VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Joe was a good officer, one of the best I ever worked with. He could handle anything. But more important he was a good, good man. He had a fine family, and he served Autauga County well," former Sheriff Herbie Johnson told the Montgomery Advertiser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johnson hired Sedinger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By state law, Autauga County Coroner Buster Barber, takes over as sheriff until the governor appoints a new sheriff. Since Sedinger's latest term hasn't started, Ivey could call for a special election.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We will always be grateful for his many years of service and I know that his death is a major loss, especially to the people of Autauga County," Ivey said in her statement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

			<title>Alabama teens arrested in drive-by shooting that killed 12-year-old</title>
			<description>Alabama teenagers were arrested in a drive-by shooting that killed a 12-year-old girl who was asleep in her home on Wednesday. The suspects fired 17 bullets inside the home.</description>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two teenagers face murder charges in a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime" target="_blank"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt; this week that left a sleeping 12-year-old girl in Alabama dead, police said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Murder warrants were issued for Ja’Von Eric Wilson, 19, and Jarei Lamar Vance, 18, both of Birmingham, Sgt. Monica Law said Friday. The suspects were charged in the death of Audriana "Minnie" Pearson, who was killed as she slept in her home early Wednesday, al.com reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mayor Randall Woodfin said Minnie had been &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/getting-heart-christmas" target="_blank"&gt;looking forward to celebrating Christmas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"But while she slept in her bed last night, her life was robbed from her. She was the victim of a drive-by, another one of our children stolen from us due to the intentional and reckless behavior of others," Woodfin wrote Wednesday on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alabama-judge-suspended-violating-judicial-ethics-2020" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALABAMA JUDGE SUSPENDED FOR VIOLATING JUDICIAL ETHICS IN 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mayor told al.com that 17 bullets were fired into the home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Police were able to identify a vehicle suspected to be involved in the drive-by through leads and the department’s crime center, which uses real-time technology and data-driven intelligence to increase prevention, apprehension and resolution of crime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A pursuit spanned several miles before the vehicle was stopped, Law said, and three people were taken into custody. &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/alabama-execution-called-off-death-warrant-expires-issues-accessing-veins" target="_blank"&gt;Warrants for capital murder&lt;/a&gt; were obtained for both Wilson and Vance. Wilson was also charged with first-degree receiving stolen property.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both men are being held without bond in the Jefferson County Jail. It's unknown if either has an attorney who could speak on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third person of interest taken into custody was released.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Woodfin said he spoke to the girl’s mother after the shooting. Pearson would have turned 13 next month, the mayor said. She had been hoping for a pink iPad or AirPods for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There is very little to be merry about in households where laughter has been silenced by gunfire, and that breaks my heart," the mayor wrote.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
